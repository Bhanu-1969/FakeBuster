Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3,OR,The die itself is fine. I just was trying to get one that would expand the brass to .358 for loading coated 9mm bullets. This is still too small for that.

Electronics_5,5,CG,Perfect for my new laptop!  I love the feel of the mouse. The buttons are just as responsive and precise.
Electronics_5,5,CG,The MCX adaptor is just what I needed.  The included adapter works great for the first couple of months and then the phone
Electronics_5,4,CG,Fun to play with but not an easy task. I will say that it's been pretty stable since I got it.
Electronics_5,4,OR,Nice sound.  For the price range it's a great option. Use it by the pool.  Does seem to take a bit of time to sync.
Electronics_5,5,OR,It works fine and was a great replacement when I frayed the cord of the original charger. I bought three of them to put in various classrooms.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"My laptop does not have card reader and I need something like this one. I bought one, which was falling in pieces. This one is virtually indestructible."
Electronics_5,4,OR,"There is very noticeable distortion (especially with straight horizons) at the wide end. The lens is acceptably sharp at  wide aperture, and very sharp from F5.6."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"LOVE IT, LOVE IT!! Works great and to be able to listen to music with a beanie on in the winter is GREAT! Love the color too!"
Electronics_5,4,OR,"Works well in Cubase 5.5 on Windows 7, using asio4All as the driver.  Will hickup and drop out until you find the buffer size sweet spot."
Electronics_5,5,OR,Purchased specifically for a GoPro hero 3+ Black.  It's on the GoPro recommended SD Card list and is capable of recording 4K video.  Very fast.

Electronics_5,5,OR,"They are very cheap, work very well on my Android and Tablet, better-made than I expected. Prefer these to a sharp plastic stylus, they won't damage screen!"
Electronics_5,5,OR,"So far only one was damaged, but I think it was the data I entered, not the dvd. They have been very useful and I love them."
Electronics_5,4,OR,"Very convenient product.  I love what it does, and the price was right.  Not super HQ, but it doesnt really need to do much, so...."

Electronics_5,3,OR,"It does what it supposed to do, but it is not any better or clearer than the protective layer that already comes on the Google Nexus 10."

Electronics_5,5,OR,These are much better than the Uniden OEM batteries. Having 1400mAh makes a world of difference. My portable Uniden phones last much longer off the base chargers.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Not making it draw high current (<1amp). That said, it works as supposed to as far as providing space saving in comparison to a straight in plug."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"easy to set up, works great, picked up about 30 channels with a mountain between house and hill where transmitters are at ,what else can i say"
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Upgrading old infrastructure of patched together cables, worn cables, and old cameras, the cost of these is perfect for the current project where additional length is needed."

Electronics_5,5,OR,This modem works great.  I've had this quite a while now and never had a problem.  Recommend if you need both wireless and wired connections.

Electronics_5,5,CG,"Great router, everyone in my house has the same problem. I need to turn off the router and the other two fail."
Electronics_5,5,CG,"I only use SanDisk cards, not the SDHC cards I need.

The only downside is that the card is a bit pricey"
Electronics_5,5,CG,"Now you can mount 2 speakers on top of each other.

The only reason I ordered this is because I had a friend who was"
Electronics_5,1,CG,"Not worth it. It sticks out of the case and you can't even close it.Very nice.I bought this for a friend,"
Electronics_5,5,CG,I needed these after replacing a pair of earphones. I also needed to replace the earphones in my pair of earphones.

Electronics_5,5,CG,"Nifty little flash drives. I use it as a backup drive for my computer, and I have one in a pair of the computer's"
Electronics_5,5,CG,Does the job just fine.  I love the feel of the lens.  The only thing that is a little off is the plastic part
Electronics_5,5,CG,Simply a well built product.  I love the feel of the lens.  The zoom is awesome.  If you want to get a

Electronics_5,5,OR,This is the Mercedes of home networking routers. Fills my house with a strong signal. the 5GHz band is perfect with my Nvidia SHIELD. Great management interface.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"This little book light is great for the price, the light is broad and spreads across both pages and the clip is secure enough not to fall off."
Electronics_5,4,OR,Great drive. Clean and basic. Not super fast but not super slow. It does crap out and have smart errors if you plug it in and out enough.
Electronics_5,5,OR,great headphones. sounds good and loud as I like it. a must buy!!! the headphones comes with three different size rubbers and a case for storage very nice.
Electronics_5,1,OR,This item did not work when plugged into my car slot. Tried both my cars and did not work. Wouldn't suggest anyone to waste their time on this.
Electronics_5,3,OR,"Mostly ok, but I never found a connector tip that fit snugly in my Compaq laptop.

In the end I used electrical tape to hold the tip in place."

Electronics_5,3,OR,"Apparently such a simple setup is very hard to do. Easy to install, but the audio quality left something to be greatly desired. Static, buzzing, and over-amplified volume."
Electronics_5,3,OR,"Sticks well, but over time about a year it showed ripples where I slide it in the iLuv case. I need to learn how to get it replaced."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I bought it for carrying our camera during our hiking trip. It has multiple pockets to store camera, batteries, and memory card. I was very happy with it."

Electronics_5,2,CG,This power supply causes the CPU to fail.  Not sure if it's a technical issue or just a hardware problem.  I am using this
Electronics_5,5,CG,"Only issue is that is what happens when you try to set it up for a new computer.  You can't adjust the CPU, memory,"
Electronics_5,5,CG,Got DVI video on our TV. The only problem is that it's only a small screen and we have a small HDMI cable.

Electronics_5,5,CG,I bought it to put on my computer. It worked perfectly. I also have a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 and it seems to work great.
Electronics_5,5,CG,"Blacks are actually black, colors are a little too bright. I did not need a fix, just to get a solution."

Electronics_5,4,OR,It doesn't seem to receive as well as a ground plane antenna but the SWRs are fine and it has held up in a few very nasty wind storms.
Electronics_5,4,OR,The sd case is durable and securely holds the memory cards.  Works as it should and no complaints except how difficult it was to find sd only cases.
Electronics_5,1,OR,It's unfortunate from micro USB connector failed after about 35 days of continuous use. If you can't charge it you can't use it. This is a basic design fault.
Electronics_5,5,OR,i love this case it has a nice black finish and all components fit comfortably inside with room to spare. It also has ample room for cooling and extras.

Electronics_5,1,OR,Having similar issues to others. Programming interface is easy but the display is the opposite of that shown. the back light is very bright and the letters are dark

Electronics_5,5,CG,This San Disk micro HC-C2307W is a great product for the price.  It is so small that it can be folded down and

Electronics_5,5,CG,"Great pads, renewed my headphones. I love the feel of the headphones. The sound is awesome. The range is amazing."
Electronics_5,5,CG,I will be honest I do not know how long this will last. I have a few of these and they have lasted a long time.

Electronics_5,5,OR,"Hey.  It's a barrel adaptor.  About as sexy as thumb tacks.  Works like a champ, and well finished.  Can't say much more about a barrel adaptor."
Electronics_5,2,OR,"Got this as replacement for first gen iPad that was slow. This unit would not connect to my home WiFi. Seemed slower than the old
iPad I sold."
Electronics_5,3,OR,Working ok just not great at night or when it has a little water on it. But for the price I would say it is doing its job for now.
Electronics_5,5,OR,These work great and have stood the wear and tear of kids. Well built and dependable . Would recommend these to anyone for their children. They get used almost daily
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Very sturdy surge strip for a solid price. Haven't had my house struck by lightning, so I can't comment on the effectiveness, but I'm trusting $1000 of hardware to it."

Electronics_5,5,OR,"Bought several for use with an iPhone 6.  They're very well made, much nicer than the Apple cables, and are all still in excellent condition after moderately rough use."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Works well... records games... but if you are looking to use it for recording anything else through your XBOX, it won't work. Its just game play, not Netflix or TV."

Highly Recommended if you are looking for the convenience of wifi.....beats buying a new camera!"

Electronics_5,5,OR,Great cheap pair of headphones.  Sweat doesn't seem to bother them.  They seem indestructible.  Sound is good.  Super-light.  You can barely feel them.  Great for jogging.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"the screen is super amazing
i used it on a surface pro 4 and the screen split makes more productive and the quality of colors is even more than the surface screen itself"

The slightest wind will knock it off the table, and break the feet if they're clamped."

Electronics_5,5,OR,"No-nonsense SATA interface. Plug-and-play. It doesn't work on full-sized, 3.5"" spinners, but that is to be expected. 3.5"" spinners usually require additional power. For SSDs and older laptop drives, this is wonderful!"

Electronics_5,5,CG,"This little pushes out a lot of air.  Not too hot or too cold, but not too hot.  Doesn't get hot.  The sound is okay"
Electronics_5,5,CG,"Works great. Exact replace for $60, with the instructions included.  If you have a larger computer, you'll want to get a solid replacement. "

While the 6.5 is the most solid and sharp lens out there"
Electronics_5,4,OR,"Nice product that will add a lot of production value. Only complaint is that the wheels came with the manufacturing ring still around it. You will need to sand the ""extra"" rubber down"
Electronics_5,4,OR,Brush works well but I wish it had a cap to keep dirt out of it when in storage. Smudge tip works pretty well too. Looks cheap but feels well made.
Electronics_5,4,OR,This  device is a bargain at the price. It is great for travel or home use. A negative is that the user manual is poorly translated into English from (I assume) Chinese.
Electronics_5,3,OR,Connections are light duty and can break as mine did. It should come with a power supply as the connector is metric and was a little difficult to find a mate that fit.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Great little speaker!  Connects right to USB port, not bulky!  Nice to have while just lounging in bed or on couch and need a little more sound!  Excellent sound quality!!"
Electronics_5,5,OR,This is the best option i've found for wiring a speaker-level output from a receiver to an RCA style input on an amp. The female to female connectors will come in handy too.
Electronics_5,4,OR,its a compact bag. if you want carry more things. its better you bought bigger one. its tight fit bag. if you want to buy bag for only camera its a good one.
Electronics_5,1,OR,"I couldn't stream content off of the device to anything. I gave up shortly after I got it and sent it back. Not worth the money, the app and device just 'aren't' there."
Electronics_5,4,OR,Overall its working great - I just have to turn it off and back on sometimes so that it plays audio from a WDTV live player. But at this price its a bargain.
Electronics_5,4,OR,"for the price, this is a good set.
i can't tell more expensive ones from less, so price is a good sorting tool for me.
really only wanted the UV for protecting my lens anyway."
Electronics_5,5,OR,I had my friend get this boombox because he almost got into a 2 year contract that would have cost him over $600. Ifound this on Amazon for him and it works great!

Electronics_5,5,OR,"Holy Moses, what's not to like about this lens? OK, sure... it's 1.8 and not 1.4, but seriously! For the price what do you expect? This lens should be in EVERY starter bag."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Bigbox store wanted 4 times as much for a shorter cable,
use it daily plug/ unplug, roll it up throw it in my laptop case, don't treat it very well and it still works!"
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I added these two batteries, which came at an unbelievable low price to the one that came with my Pansonic Lumix camera and now I can shoot for days and days without recharging."

Electronics_5,5,OR,"If you have a Promaster XC tripod, you're probably purchasing this because you need a replacement or you'd like a second for convenience.  I fall into the latter, and this has worked great."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Just what I needed, and the price was just right.  I bought it used, with a few scratches and dings, but who cares because it works perfectly for my iPad and Samsung tablet."
Electronics_5,5,OR,only found on amazon for me. only amazon provides you with quality hdmi cables at fractions of the cost. its impressive and you don't always need those lengthly ones to get the job done.
Electronics_5,5,OR,Works really well.  My wrist and fore arm where getting achy with my normal mouse. This really helped.  Takes a little while to get used to the upright grip but worth it.
Electronics_5,5,OR,This piece does not come with the ring light. This holds my camera in the center of the ring light and allows for easy adjusting. This is a must have for ring light photographers.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"My dad received this as a gift. He loves photography and this made him think he was getting a new lens. Excellent work maKing a replica! Good deal, good seal, nice cosmetics and texture."
Electronics_5,3,OR,Son loves the sound and they look nice but the leather like material around the ear pads has come off and no real way to secure it back.  Only had them since Christmas.
Electronics_5,5,OR,I have used literally thousands of discs of various brands and I have found these PHILLIPS discs to be extremely reliable. I've recorded a dozen different file formats and could not be more satisfied.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"This is the only earbud that fits my particular aural cavities, and the sleek controls have become a welcome addition to my daily travel. I dread the day when my last pair breaks !"
Electronics_5,3,OR,I loved the idea of this-that i could listen to my music in the car. it was easy to set up. but only works fairly. fades in and out frequently. also is easily broken.
Electronics_5,5,OR,Great! I can actually hear the individual instruments on what I am listening to. I love getting really hammered on the weekends and watching Youtube and these Etymotic earphones make my buzz more enjoyable
Electronics_5,5,OR,Great sound. Much louder than I expected. The Bluetooth signal never drops off and battery life is at least a couple of days worth of workouts. I haven't run the battery completely dead though
Electronics_5,3,CG,I bought this camera because it has the quality and features of a Canon DSLR. I'm an amateur photographer and had a Canon DSLR that I had a couple of years
Electronics_5,5,CG,"This case is great, the material is nice and the instructions are clear.

The only downside is that the case is a bit thick.  The plastic feels cheap and"

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it's a bit small, but if you're"
Electronics_5,5,CG,"I didn't even know Rockford had an open mic, which is a nice bonus. I was just blown away by how the soundstage, including the clarity, was crystal"
Electronics_5,5,CG,This amp is great power supply. The only problem is that it comes with a small screw driver. I wish it had a plastic screwdriver. The other problem is the power
Electronics_5,5,CG,Great tools for your camera!  Excellent quality.  Easy to use.  Great price!  Works as advertised.  The only thing I wish is the instruction booklet.
Electronics_5,5,CG,"Year and a half later, it's still running. I'm not sure how I can say this is an issue, but I am considering getting another one if I'm going"
Electronics_5,5,CG,"Quick shipping and keyboard looks nice. The case is comfortable and it fits my iPad perfectly.

I would not recommend this product for anyone.Works as expected, no issues"

Electronics_5,2,CG,"Offers excellent protection and excellent sound. The only problem is that it comes with a small screwdriver.

I had to replace the screwdriver with the TRS-"

I had to replace a defective one with the new one."

Electronics_5,5,CG,"I love it!  I use it everyday with my phone and it works great.  I just wish it had a mic.  I wish it had a mic, but"
Electronics_5,5,CG,I am getting to where I need it.  I've got a lot of things to do.  I am using it for a portable desktop and have a laptop in it
Electronics_5,1,CG,Nothing happens or can happen.  The only way to fix it is to just throw the one in a bag.  The plastic part is also very stiff and not flexible.
Electronics_5,5,CG,I JUST THOUGHT I WOULDN'T BE A LITTLE GENTLE PYTHONER.I had a lot of trouble with the TV
Electronics_5,5,OR,"A Person (s) asked me to by these (3) for her- them. One was very pleased!  WV is hilly , so no signal could be picked up . But it is a good product."

Electronics_5,5,OR,"Does not have the ""soft"" feel of a leather case - but it is what it is.  Perfect fit - protects the kindle - and easy to handle.  Very sturdy and looks good."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"great item! no more need to sit right by outlet. made well. my old style still works after years with ipad 2. now with ipad air, new style is very good after months of use."
Electronics_5,4,OR,Very nice replacements to my iPod ear buds.  Sound quality is at least as good and the cord is longer.  Alos the angled minijack helps keep the ear phones from becoming unpluged easily.
Electronics_5,4,OR,"The sound is amazing but I can't really make them stay inside my ear, and I've tried all included sizes of the rubber. If you move the cable it ""rubs"" and you can hear it."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"What can I say it works as needed, usually last around 3 hours of full use on a battery only.  For the price you can't beat the battery.  It fit perfectly as well."
Electronics_5,1,OR,Never could get this thing to work right. I hook it up to all the right connections; but get no response on the monitor. It has been added to my dust bin of useless parts.
Electronics_5,5,OR,Worked as stated cleared my issue on one camera and the other turned out to be a bad camera...The third was the bnc touching my alum. trim on soffit caused another ground.. All happy now..
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Used with Nikon d5200. Water does not leak. The finger pockets are placed in the right position. The lens section is large enough for a long lens, but is kinda annoying for a short lens."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"This is super quiet,  works great keeps my laptop cool. The blue light it has makes it look great,  it is also helpful to see the keys in the dark."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"At this price point, these stands are sturdy, spring loaded, beefy, strong and have a decent case.  They are not small but are considerably lighter than other brands.  They are definitely a bargain!"
Electronics_5,5,OR,As long as they don't lose any files from my weddings I love them. I have never lost files from a wedding so I worry when I purchase new CF cards. So far so good.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Nice, simple, basic, small.  Purchased as a gift, so I can't speak from experience, but I did open it up and look at it.  Was a good fit for a small Nikon Coolpix."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"After trying 3 different models, this one it has the best reception from my phone and tablet!! It works as a transmitter too if you have an equipment without Bluetooth like an old mp3 player."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"You will read that the Hopper can take an external drive with a max of 3 terabytes, but this 3 terabyte drive works perfectly. It was truly plug and play.  I highly recommend it!"
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I am really impressed with the sound quality of these headphones. They are very comfortable and I love the fact that they fold up. I wish the plug was angled,but this is a minor issue."
Electronics_5,4,OR,"It's a good little clock, it is not too bright. You get what you pay for, however it will not pick up an FM station 20 miles away but it is a good alarm clock."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Can't give a true feed back for this as got it for my son, but he loves loves it updated for an older version he had a long time and it never let him down"
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Worked fantastically. Good heavy paper makes an easy seamless background. Good color as well. It is heavy and it does want to unroll, but I read the comments here and was prepared with a clamp."
Electronics_5,5,OR,It was a top quality product but it was not compatible with my system so I had to return make sure to check I did but got poor information. Still it was a good product.
Electronics_5,5,OR,Works great ! just be careful of putting to much cleaner on your dash but even with that you have to take corner pretty fast to get this to slide. I would def buy again
Electronics_5,5,CG,For $17 it was a bargain. The quality is good but it's not a perfect fit. The bottom is too tight and the plastic feels cheap and the plastic feels cheap.
Electronics_5,2,CG,"The button on the left side has the ""W"" key, which is a key to recognize.

The mic is also a bit small, but if you don't mind"

Electronics_5,1,CG,"Really, really cheap.  The mic has the quality of a good pair of headphones, the bass is good, and the mic is very comfortable.  The sound is crystal clear"
Electronics_5,3,CG,"Works good. Don't get it confused with the wide-angle model.  If you have a full-frame camera, the lens will be a bit wider than you think."
Electronics_5,3,CG,"It is ok, seem to be a little noisy, but I will keep it for the next one.I bought this for a friend, and he is very happy with the purchase"
Electronics_5,4,CG,"Take your Sat radio and go to the Buy/Receive buttons on your iPad.

Electronics_5,5,CG,"Great product.  I didn't know it was an inch longer than the original one, but I'm glad I did.  The plastic part is also very light and easy to"
Electronics_5,5,CG,This product worked exactly as described. The only problem is that it did not work properly when the speaker is placed in the phone. The speaker is then randomly picked up when it is
Electronics_5,1,CG,This product was OK.  But it didn't work.  My computer didn't recognize it and the other two computers had the same problem.  The TV was not working.
Electronics_5,1,CG,I am in the process of upgrading my system to a newer Intel Gb2. I have an HP Pavilion 8.1. The latest version is running a Nvidia 750W CPU
Electronics_5,1,CG,"I wanted to like this stylus, but it just wasn't as good as I expected. It is so small that it's not portable and takes up a lot of space."
Electronics_5,3,CG,"Ok this is a toss up. The quality is ok but it's not really the best one.

I had a friend who said that the sound was ""good"" and"
Electronics_5,5,CG,"This little device is perfect for me and the price. I will keep this in mind when buying.I bought this for a friend, and he is very happy with the purchase."
Electronics_5,5,CG,Works great with a 2014 MacBook Pro and an AMD Athlon X2 processor. I have one in my office and the other in a office. The sound is great.

Electronics_5,5,OR,"The item finish is extremely well done. The reflection works very good on both black and white items. So far, I really do not have any complaints.

Thank you, I will definitely buy more from your store!!

Mario"
Electronics_5,2,OR,I've only had it for 6 months. Half the screen doesn't even show up anymore and now it's not vibrating for notifications or when I've met my goal. Serious suckage. Will not purchase this brand again.
Electronics_5,5,OR,I couldn't be happier with this purchase. Everything was just as described. The PC came loaded with a genuine copy Windows 10 and a 90-day warranty. The system is fast and responsive. Perfect for my needs.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Great purchase
Bought this one because the office pull boxes were painful.
This bag is nicely constructed, nice compartments, and even distribution of weight. The wheels roll smoothly. It's not high society style, but perfect for my needs."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"A small external drive that backs up my computer.  It is easy to take with me and I have satisfaction that if my computer develops a problem, I will not lose my files and applications."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"This case has extra soften material inside that provides excellent protection for the mac. Compare with another similar case that I bought before, this case is the best one for the price and for the design."
Electronics_5,1,OR,Just got this. It is not universal for ski poles. It does not fit on the slim carbon composite  ski poles. They don't tell you that. It also broke.
Electronics_5,1,OR,This router drops the signal on a consistent basis.  Too bad it started happening after my 30 days and I can't return it.  Plus one of the antenna's fell off during the initial installation
Electronics_5,5,OR,"This is a high quality surge protector for a reasonable price. I trust the APC brand above many other brands, and the high quality of this unit is very apparent when compared with cheaper surge protectors."
Electronics_5,4,OR,"I was able to watch my beloved Baltimore Ravens on my laptop while sitting in a parking lot Cody, Wyoming.  4-stars only because the picture quality could have been better, but, it worked as advertised."
Electronics_5,2,OR,I got the 15ft cable but mine does not charge as fast. I had purchased the 6ft white cable from here before and it works great but I needed a longer cable and not satisfied. 
Electronics_5,5,OR,Son loves the thing carries it around with him. Loud lots of bass has it paired to iPhone and Samsung tablet. Uses it to charge his phone on car trips. Very good quality and excellent sound
Electronics_5,5,OR,This is a great price for a filter.  It appears to be glass and protects well.  Hasn't scratched so far.  I would recommend it instead of the very high prices some stores charge.
Electronics_5,4,OR,"I'm not sure where the review went that I already left for this product a few days ago. He's a brief re-post. Nice mount, easy install. Needs adjustment for tightening part that mounts directly to monitor."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"This is the remote that should have come with the TV, like the keyboard for doing searches on YouTube.  Would recommend this remote to Vizio ""smart TV"" owner who didn't get one with their TV."
Electronics_5,4,OR,I have been using this drive for my mac book pro with the hard drive tray for about 6 months and it has worked flawless. The increase of the speed of the computer was very notorious.
Electronics_5,4,OR,I needed a way to hook up my external sata dock to one of my computers and it killed me using 2.0 USB port over eSata. This dropped right into my system and solved my problem.
Electronics_5,5,OR,For this price it solid. you get tons of the bells and whistles you can not get with this care for the price range. It stays very cool and it very solid case.
Electronics_5,5,OR,This battery allows me to shoot all day without worrying about how much juice I have left. This kind of peace of mind is priceless. A professional battery for professional photographers that gets the job done.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"These are *great*. Replaced an ancient set of 10"" Fischer speakers that had been with me since college (they were circuit breaker protected, fortunately!). These are primarily used for theater fronts, and they have great sound."
Electronics_5,5,CG,"Love it, cut down my cable. Great Product!Very good quality. Nice little speaker! Works great. Great price!Works great. The sound is great."
Electronics_5,5,CG,"Excellent fit, very well made.  I love the materials.  The zipper is a little loose, but is so small that it doesn't bother me.  I think the zipper"
Electronics_5,5,CG,Awesome action cam. 1080p is what I wanted. Great sound. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the front of the camera is a little tight.

Electronics_5,5,CG,"These are not exactly like the ones I bought, but I did find that the dimensions were just right.  The ear buds are a bit small, but if you don't mind having"

Electronics_5,4,CG,Probably the best boombox I've ever owned.  I've also owned a Sony Rollei (which I had a lot of trouble with) and a Sony EOS
Electronics_5,4,CG,I'd give it 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that it's a little hard to use.  I had to use a toothpick to get it to work.

Electronics_5,2,CG,"To navigate DVD menus you have to go through the menus of the computer that you want to use.

I had to use a ""play"" button to get to the menu."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"These work great. I bought the same in different sizes for different applications. I would buy again. If you need just a couple, make sure you measure the diameter of your cup holder or whatever, before ordering."
Electronics_5,4,OR,"It works nicely. To customize it is a pain. Double press this button, hold that one for 16 seconds, yadda yadda...with with some time and patience you'll get it to where you want as far as sound."
Electronics_5,4,OR,"Pros:
Super adorable
Sturdy

Cons:
It's a little on the heavy side
the chain could have been a little longer.

Final Thoughts:
This was an adorable gift for those owl lovers. It was such a surprise when you find out that it's a USB"
Electronics_5,5,OR,I just needed something portable to take away the harshness of my external speedlite for when I cannot take my other equipment with me. I love the velcro strap and that it can fold flat for storage.
Electronics_5,5,OR,I bought these way too lengthy but since they are excellent cables i don't mind. Will find a use for the 80ft i have left (haha). Get these with some banana plugs and you're good to go.
Electronics_5,5,OR,If you want loud clear clean sound these speakers will shred your hearing. They are amazing and don't cost a lot. They look great in my car and blow my head off. Very happy great job Rockford!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Electronics_5,5,OR,Ummmmm . . . this actually didn't work with my Mac.  Didn't work with Yosemite.  Gave it away to someone who had Windows.  Maybe they fixed the problem but I don't have it anymore.
Electronics_5,5,OR,Like this trackman & for the price it is great once you get use to it it will become an old friend at first I was not sure I liked it but now I like it allot
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Perfect!!! Just what we needed for our camper, the old burned out. If we had taken it to the RV place they quoted us $230.00 PLUS Labor to install it...  This price felt like a steal~~~"
Electronics_5,5,OR,This is the fastest charger I've ever used. It literally charges from low battery to 100% in less than an hour. But it does need an outlet plug. It's much slower when a USB port is used
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Best keyboard cover I've had to date. Laptop keys still have a little bit of ""give"", which I like, and the material just feels nice on the fingertips. Will buy more once I'll wear this one out."
Electronics_5,4,OR,I purchased this set as a last minute purchase- the product is good. It chages quickly and is lighter than the Nikon brand I had been using. The car charger is great. Good product for the price.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Great price. Very fast. Had it for over a year now with no issue.
Durable little thing.
I have owned this for years now and it is always taking punishment on my key-chain and still going strong. Very durable."
Electronics_5,5,OR,I'm thinking C.DelSol just didn't switch displays on his laptop. By default laptops only have a video signal to the built-in screen.  There usually is a FN key combination to turn on the external video port.
Electronics_5,5,OR,Well worth the $$ ....My Garmin wasn't holding a charge anymore. Figured I'd give this battery a shot. I really think this battery holds a charge longer than my original. Love it. Easy to install yourself too!
Electronics_5,5,OR,"These work nicely, but the actual ""holder"" for the
cannon battery is a ""sled"" that likes to fall off the charger..  I lost one sled, bought a second charger.  The second unit I taped that down."
Electronics_5,1,OR,Disregard any review where the cable wasn't cut to make a run.  Every reviewer who cut the cable has pointed out that it is not Cat6.  There aren't any copper wires. This cable is junk.
Electronics_5,5,OR,I love this camera and all of it's many features.  Don't buy the kit lens. It is not worth the extra money.  I put a C. Zeiss 24-70mm lens on it and it is wonderful.
Electronics_5,4,OR,Can't beat the price.  We were building a new home and wanted these buried in the wall so we needed a lot of them and at this price it did not kill us to do it.
Electronics_5,3,OR,"Very imprecisely. You have to try very hard to make it work on the screen. Well, I guess the tablet was not designed to be written on anyway so the pen is an OK product to me."

Electronics_5,5,CG,"Just does the job as expected. The only problem is that it comes with a small screwdriver. I bought this for a friend, and he is very happy with the purchase."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Love it. In my retirement days I use it daily with my W10 Dell Venue 8 Pro for emails, browsing and Youtubes. It sure beats using the on-screen keyboard. For ""heavy duty"" full-size applications I use my laptop."
Electronics_5,5,OR,Bought this as a gift upon the recommendation of someone else.  The recipient really likes it.  It had to be easy for him to use because he is 86.  He really seems to like it.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"How much do I love Samsung SSDs? Too much, probably. Great price for when you want that insane improvement in all things speed. Use this as a boot drive and put all your data on a 7200RPM HDD."

Electronics_5,4,OR,I bought this lcd last Christmas to be used in my bedroom. I have no complaints. The picture and sound are fine for late night viewing. The sleep timer is very convenient. I consider this a great value...

Electronics_5,5,OR,Cable works fine-hubby thought it was crap until he discovered the little plastic caps on the end. Once he got it hooked up to the TV and soundbar he stopped calling it crap and started calling it awesome.
Electronics_5,5,OR,Just as good as the battery that comes with the GoPro but cheaper and you get two. I have not tried to charge the official battery in the charger but the Wasabi batteries charge in the GoPro fine.
Electronics_5,4,OR,"bought this for the media pc in my bedroom.  the only thing I don't like about it is the touch pad, but I don't want to have to deal with trying to use a mouse in bed..."

Electronics_5,3,OR,"Works well, Two issues.  It is impossible to focus on higher magnifications without having the object being looked at up inside the opaque plastic cone.  Also the light is not dimmable and is sometimes too bright."
Electronics_5,5,CG,I use it in the garage and it does the job well.  I have a large collection of other external hard drives and I am using it in the garage to store a lot of data.

WARNING: It is fairly small, I wouldn't recommend this keyboard for heavy long-term use, keys are small as well."

Now it's gone -- no light, no sound.

Not very durable."

Electronics_5,5,OR,"it fits my tab 10.1, my boyfriend's tab 7.0, my iphone, his galaxy sl, fits anything you want to stand. It is adjustable, and adjustments are small hence you can make small adjustment to fit your viewing angle perfectly."

The opening is also too wide for a single charging cable (iphone) and will not hold it in place.

Probably works fine for indoor use on larger diameter cables."

Electronics_5,2,OR,We did not have a lot of success with this product. USB devices worked better. As I recall we had some setup problems and well and it's still setting in a drawer in a desk someplace. Would not buy again.
Electronics_5,4,OR,"I like these cable ties, because you can make them the size that you need. Be careful not to put them too tight. I did once, & the end broke off when I tried to untie it. They fit tight."
Electronics_5,1,OR,This Optoma projector died after 2 years. I've been replacing 2 lamp bulbs in a year and now the color wheel went bad.  The noise of this projector is annoying and horrible. Don't waste your money on this projector.
Electronics_5,4,OR,"I've owned several of these (I lose them frequently), and I love them. They would be a perfect 5, except they come with the terrible U3 software, with no indication of how to remove it. Here is how to remove it:

Electronics_5,5,OR,I bought this cable to replace the one that came with my Sony Portable drive.  The mailman left the package on the front lawn and my dog ripped it to shreds.  This cable works perfectly with my drive.
Electronics_5,4,OR,"I did an install job with this in a 96 Land Rover Discovery. The cables made the length of the whole vehicle, they stripped easy, and made some pretty sharp corners. I will be using these again in future installs!"
Electronics_5,5,OR,Bought this to replace the Canon OEM cap when I lose it...it's just a matter of when. Pinch mechanism works well and fits just as well as original. Bought this for a Canon 18-135mm STM lens and would certainly recommend.
Electronics_5,1,OR,"This lens cleaner didn't work at all... My other car's CD rom skips a few seconds of each track and I was hoping this will clean the dust and thus fix it, but nope, it didn't do that at all!"
Electronics_5,3,OR,"The 'tulip' shape makes weird shadows, like a vignette, and you have to keep moving it until that goes away. Sometimes it doesn't go away at all. I would've rather had the round shaped lens hood but couldn't find one."
Electronics_5,4,OR,I like the fact that it does not have to be recharged so often and more for the fact that it works with all of my electronics. I am a gadget person and this is an awesome tool for me.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Didnt know this particular adapter  was  a  dish network  stick
All in all  a good value  in lieu of getting an original Panasonice stick and paying 5 times more than this one.
Glad i bought it."
Electronics_5,4,OR,I like my transmitter  for the most part there isn't a lot of intereference like I had with my last one. Though there are still times that I still get it if I try adjusting the volume or heat.
Electronics_5,5,OR,They are inexpensive but are clear and seem to be well made and worth the price. Nice case to keep them in. Best part they are fulfilled by digital Goja an excellent company to do business with. Great customer service.

Electronics_5,5,OR,"Really good, comes with extension cord, and sticker. Packaging designed by fort knoxx, but looks nice. Sounds great, and looks good too. The microphone sounds okay, but I would recommend buying a snowball for any really intensive need for quality."
Electronics_5,1,OR,"I had previously wrote a 5 star review for this product. Sadly, after only 2 months the camera stopped working. I tried to contact the seller, but it appears that is not possible outside of the return window. Very disappointed."
Electronics_5,2,OR,I wanted to use it as a signature pad but it didn't work for my needs. It appears to function well for graphics arts but I'm not a graphic artist so I'm not an expert on how it should function.
Electronics_5,4,OR,"It works as advertised, so far (about 3 months) no problem.  I cover the screen while driving because it can be a distraction.  Once set, the camera comes on and records without any operator input, set and forget."

Electronics_5,4,OR,this particular one i had to send back because it was the wrong one. i needed it for Nikon. but this works perfect. make sure it says 1/8000 sync . because there is a 1/250 that does not work past 1/250
Electronics_5,5,OR,it does the job. the fans aren't any louder than the ones built into my laptop. truthfully i can't tell the difference in the sound. i would recommend it fully. it puts the computer at the right hight and angle too.
Electronics_5,2,OR,"I bought this antenna in hopes of receiving more OTA TV. But ended up only getting about 2 channels that didn't seem to work half the time. I switched to the Winegard Metrostar 2000, and have had a lot better success."
Electronics_5,4,OR,Have been using it for a week continuously. Great battery life and quality. Very easy to pair and use with devices. Noticed the audio drop when the phone is moves a lot. Would definitely not go back to a wired headphone!
Electronics_5,5,OR,This was purchased as a gift for our 19 year old who has a real interest in photograph. He has fallen in love with the Nikon gem and is rarely seen without it. Easy to use - great photos as well.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"These are Great! The battery lasts pretty much forever. Sound is excellent, noise cancellation is phenomenal! Range could be better but it's right on par with any competing headphones, I've just been spoiled by the old Motorola S11's."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I used these by the millions (well, maybe not millions...). Not thick or super grip, but the extra length makes up for that. At the price of these you can use them everywhere. Also, cut them in half for smaller cords."
Electronics_5,5,OR,Seems to be well made. Terminals are slightly cheap on the inside but look like they will hold up fine. Installed a Skar 12 inch shallow sub in mine with some poly fill on the sides and the setup pounds hard!

Electronics_5,4,OR,"This is a good little case for the Nuvi. I gave it 4 stars because I think it's missing some protective padding if accidentally dropped or hit.
It should come with the Garmin Nuvi and should not have to be bought separately."
Electronics_5,3,OR,Buggy when setting up m. 2 wound up buying a pcie m. 2 extension card which defeated the purpose of this board. A simple bios update would fix it but a this is a dying socket type don't hold your breath.

Electronics_5,5,OR,"Helps to keep my Jaybird Bluebuds in ear without the wings, works great, hold up long, don't get too nasty and i just wipe off on shirt if they come out with a friend (sorry gross but it doesn't look dirty afterwards)"
Electronics_5,5,OR,"In terms of color and contrast, this is the best lens I have for my Sony A6000. My Sigma 30 2.8 lens is close to this Rokinon. I love the effective 18mm angle and highly recommend it, especially given the modest price."
Electronics_5,2,OR,If you are use to a standard video camera....do not purchase this item.  I had a sony HD handycam that lasted only 4 years...but the picture was outstanding.  I may send this camera back if Amazon will take it back......
Electronics_5,5,OR,Went from several years of Dish network toy to DirecTv and never looked back. We placed the RF boxes downstairs and change the channels from the piggy backed tv's with these controllers. They work great with the home distribution system from Amazon.
Electronics_5,4,OR,A very tight fit in ports and slow speed but the design is irresistible and I love storing my files on it to wear as a sort of charm. Got mine as a gift from a great friend and I treasure it.
Electronics_5,2,OR,"The stylus precision tip is very very flimsy. FYI, these styluses will not work with HP ENVY or other touch sensitive screens. So far, the only thing these worked for are my phone and tablets.

Hope this review helps with your purchase decisions."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Works like a charm. I'm using this on my Bose Wave radio  listening to Sirius XM off my phone
 BUT I had to disconnect the CD changer for it to work properly. This is a Bose issue  not the adapter."
Electronics_5,5,OR,Thank you Amazon Rep for resending this to my niece for Christmas.  She got her gift and is very happy with her product. Plus that she got in was a big plus for me and for her for most. Thank you.
Electronics_5,5,OR,Picked this up getting to lighten my load with the miles of hiking and tracking. Not realizing that the quality and strength of this unit is above amazing. Both tripod and monopod are exceptionally well crafted and sturdy pieces of professional gear.
Electronics_5,4,OR,"I purchased this with the single intention of Vudu Disc-to-Digital.  For that purpose it works great.  It is a little loud for my taste, and heats up quickly. Which makes me glad i am not using it for other purposes."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Very Very fantastic camera. Have other full size sensor SLR's and this easily holds its own. The Leica summicron lens with nano coating and digital filter is second to none. Can you say Value? Knew you could. A++++
Really wide angle as well."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"What more can I say? If you know what cable you are looking for, and you are looking for this kind of cable, you will receive this kind of cable. These are just wires with their respective connectors.

Verdict: I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT."
Electronics_5,2,OR,Card works fine until my Mac Pro 8-core goes to sleep. After that it seems impossible to restore USB connectivity. Sonnet claims the issue is that Apple broke/changed the USB driver since Mac OS X 10.6.  Read their FAQ before purchasing!
Electronics_5,1,OR,Review do-over.  Continued to ask for disc every time. It's obvious  that this product should be sold with a disc. Not solo. Never worked again question if the adaptor had any thing to do with it working the first time
Electronics_5,4,OR,"This little unit pulled me out of a pinch after a failing USB Boot drive. Installed the old hard drive in a couple minutes, booted right up and ran my installer from this. Worked like a charm, was cheap too on price."
Electronics_5,5,CG,"works great, easy to switch between monitors and monitor cases. I also love that it's been one of the first Bose headphones I've owned. The sound is crystal clear, and it's comfortable to wear."
Electronics_5,5,CG,"I was so pleased with this set, I bought a second one.

The first one is a 6 inch diameter and I am using it with the TRS-80.  The second one is a smaller"
Electronics_5,5,CG,"Hey, can't complain about this. I love the feel of the lens. The zoom is awesome. If you want to get a ""real"" zoom you'll need a tripod."
Electronics_5,5,CG,"I love this tripod! It's small and easy to carry. I also love that it's been used to mount my Bose SLR, which is also a tripod, to a tripod mount."

The only downside is that it is very small.

Pros:

Electronics_5,4,CG,"For the price, this one is an amazing quality product. I will keep my eyes peeled for the next one. I had a lot of trouble with the TV and the cover was very flimsy."
Electronics_5,5,CG,"Ubiquiti makes great equipment.  We have the latest firmware and we have a lot of options to configure.  If you want to get your feet wet, the TRS-80 is a great choice."
Electronics_5,5,CG,Great little camera. Comes on time. The only problem is that it takes a while to get used to. If you want to get a good shot then the TRS-F1235 is a good option.
Electronics_5,4,CG,"Good remote, just like the old ones, with the instructions included.  If you have a one-touch remote, the instructions are not helpful.  The instruction booklet does not say it's a remote, it"
Electronics_5,5,CG,I replaced the Ram in my old computer with the new one. This drive is a solid performer. I had to replace a solid drive in the previous computer to get it to work properly.
Electronics_5,5,CG,My 8 year old just loves it and the cord is thick enough to hold her in place. Great product. Great price. I am using it with the TRS-80 and it works just as well.
Electronics_5,4,CG,"While the unit has limitations, it has the quality to it's specifications.

The only downside is that it's very small.

Pros:
-Highly adjustable height
-The adjustable height is"
Electronics_5,5,CG,"Great sound from this Sangean.  The only problem is that it's not really a stereo, but a pair of ear buds.  I can't tell if the sound is really clear or not, but"
Electronics_5,5,CG,"The sound quality is okay, but it's not very good.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the earbuds are not as comfortable to wear.  The earbuds are still"
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I got these at a discount for my honest review. These come in handy for cleaning your screen on your electronics. They are not real big, so I also carry a couple in my purse to clean my glasses  They work well."
Electronics_5,5,OR,Works perfect with Bose headphones (quiet comfort 3). The cable looks like is good quality and the I love the fact that the 3.5mm connection is a straight connector so it is compatible with my iPhone 6S that has a bulky charging case.
Electronics_5,5,OR,Great Price for 2 batteries and a charger. Shooting video with a DSLR consumes a lot of battery and having extra ones is imperative. These don/t last as long as the Canon ones but are way way cheaper. I would Highly recommend them.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"The nicest cable I have ever used, and cheap! The wires fabric texture, light weight, slimness, and strength are the best I have ever seen.

Buy one for your headphones if they have a 3.5mm input. Won't sound better, but it will feel better."
Electronics_5,5,OR,This is my second Anker battery charger.  I usually carry one in my truck and car.  Always handy when electrical outlets are not available or easy to get to. Makes a great gift to those who have lots of electronic toys.
Electronics_5,1,OR,"case back cracked on corners within first week and proceded to warp.  The case would not stay attached to the ipad, it simply fell off after being attached.  The JETech slim-fit case is a much better choice for a budget case"
Electronics_5,2,OR,"Right out of the box I couldn't connect, directions were no help as well as tech support.  I sent it back, it's cheaply made and won't withstand much use if I'm doing obstacle races, triatholons etc... I'll wait a few more generations..."
Electronics_5,5,OR,I use this keyboard to manage servers for the company I work for. Its very compact and the capability to get both mouse and keyboard over a single USB is amazing! 5 stars to the seller and manufacturer for this great protective case.
Electronics_5,4,OR,"I find this will not work with any of the wireless functions on my 5D Mark II, but flash comp works good,
and it does the basic ETTL/II functions. I can't complain about this product at all. High Speed Sync works
great with compliant flashes."
Electronics_5,5,OR,Works very good and I like then a lot. I was a little bummed that one of the rubber war covers fell off and I can't locate it. But I never did check to make sure they were secure (you are giventhree sizes).
Electronics_5,5,OR,i was happy i bought this its cheaper in the long run if you were renting one from charter like i was. I'm very happy with this one it has never went bad or done anything stupid like kick us off the internet.
Electronics_5,5,OR,Great camera.  I can use this to take pictures of my family and save the cost of having them professionally done.  Captures everything you need.  Nothing bad about this camera at all.  Excellent lens to go with this camera.
Electronics_5,2,OR,"Great idea, but way too weak of a light to use anywhere except a pitch black roan. Not practical for slide shows in a club or office environment. I returned it and spent four times as much on an entry model office projector."
Electronics_5,4,OR,I use these for mountain biking and the sound quality is adequate. The thing I really like about these is the ability to hear ambient noised. They are NOT sound isolating like most ear buds and that's exactly what I like about them.
Electronics_5,5,OR,I've used this camera ever since attending a One Direction concert. It made the concert so memorable because of the hi def recording feature. The pictures all turned out wonderful. It's an easy camera to use and I'm very happy with my purchase
Electronics_5,5,OR,Super light weight. Real fast start up. Google Drive is easy to use and you get more than enough memory. Having all docs in google Drive is really convenient and provides a back up place to store you're docs or videos or whatever
Electronics_5,1,OR,"When I tried to charge it, my laptop locked.  My Sony laptop (Vista OS) never locked before.  I managed to un-lock it with no apparent damage to the PC.  Obviously if you can't charge the Flip you can't use it."
Electronics_5,5,CG,So cheap and they work.I love the look and feel of this case. I have one in my bedroom and the other in my office. The sound is crystal clear and it's nice to have a little extra space
Electronics_5,4,CG,I purchased this to replace a standard 3rd party HDD that came with my Dell XPS 13. 0. I had a 1TB solid state drive that was not compatible with my other Dell HDDs.

Electronics_5,4,OR,"They are very nice crisp clear speakers with a thunderous bass.  Definately a nice punch for the dolllars. I hear great things about this brand,(Boston Acoustics)but it was even more wonderful once I experienced the sound for myself.  Definately a lovely addition."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"This monitor is gigantic, and a pretty good value.  I have really enjoyed using it, enough that I am thinking of buying one and carrying it to work.  I don't know if it really is better on the eyes, but it's beautiful."
Electronics_5,5,OR,Works great - I installed this on my daughter's computer for use with bluetooth headphones - no issues at all.  Her computer does have Windows 7 - which has somewhat complicated bluetooth configuration setup - but that isn't the fault of the adapter.
Electronics_5,5,OR,I love it its very protective and i love the color. it was hard to get on but after I did get it on i have not had any problems with it and love the look of it with my ipad.
Electronics_5,4,OR,"This cable works exactly as expected. There is no signal delay, and no degradation of picture quality, even though it is really long.
Its hard to get excited about a cable, so I can't really say I LOVE it. But I would definitely recommend it."
Electronics_5,1,OR,"The PS2 connection from my mouse did not fit all the way into this adapter.  The adapter nor the mouse were recognized by the computer.  However, seeing as it was shipped from China, the adapter arrived well within the time frame indicated."
Electronics_5,3,OR,"the only problem i had with this speakers is the battery, when playing without plugin the charger the volume will become less loud
, than when the charger is plugged in, other than that the sounds is really good loud and clear but lack bass...."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Out of most of the things I have bought on Amazon I would recommend you buy this one the most. Only gripe I have is the Android wear app, there are no third party apps available yet for thinking this device to your phone"
Electronics_5,5,OR,"They just get the job done. I am an amateur video enthusiast. And, they are just the right one's for me for such a reasonable price. I can't say if it works for professionals. I just have a feeling it wont, professionals look else-where."
Electronics_5,5,OR,I use everything it comes with and the best part is that there are more things in this that what I can even think of what to use it for. This product was purchased using a promotional code to receive item at discounted price.
Electronics_5,5,OR,This strap worked just fine while I was on a river ride in Costa Rica. It also strapped right onto the helmet I used for the zip-line course. It allowed me to get some great footage of my friends while on vacation. Highly recommend.
Electronics_5,4,OR,"The design is convenient for plugging in dc adapters (bricks).  The cord to the wall outlet is long and rotates at the surge protector.
I'll hopefully never find out how well it functions as a surge protector, but at least the specs are good."
Electronics_5,4,OR,"Works nice for storing my several SD cards for my DSLR and Camcorder - and helps to keep them separate.  More space/storage than what I need but works well.  And, it's got enough bulk to not get ""lost"" in my camera bag."
Electronics_5,5,OR,I must say I have been impressed with this device. The company seems motivated to continue to improve with several firmware updates since I have had it.  Easy set up easy to use don't hesitate if you are looking to cut the cord.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"what a  great deal on these.
i used them on my 2  Yongnuo 600 LED lights
they soften them up just like a light soft  box.
they are much cheaper and more compact than buying the  soft boxes that go with these lights."
Electronics_5,1,OR,Bought in december 2015 and its already not working. Purchased for my son to ise on his xbox 1. Worked fine for about a year and now the xbox just doesnt detect it anymore. Tons of games on it that he cant access anymore.
Electronics_5,4,OR,"Works well, however the auto-switch sometimes will screw up. If Game console wakes up from sleep for updates, it will autoswitch when not wanted.  Not a big deal for me, but should be noted for others who might end up in similar situation."
Electronics_5,5,CG,"These speakers are excellent replacement speakers. The quality is just what I needed for my home theater system.I bought this for a friend, and he is very happy with the purchase.  The sound is crisp and clear. "

The only downside is that the top is a bit too small to get the cable into the place it attaches to. It is still very loose"
Electronics_5,3,CG,Sound was OK. Not very clear. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the one-touch screen was very distracting. The keyboard and mouse seemed to be a bit loose and were difficult to use.
Electronics_5,5,CG,"I  wanted a filter that would be lightweight and comfortable for my travel bag, but I just wanted a filter that would allow me to carry my camera around with me when I travel. This filter is perfect."
Electronics_5,5,CG,One of the best tips I have found for the sound of a computer speakers is to make sure the speakers are not the best. The speaker that is provided with the speakers is very large and it is difficult to fit in the
Electronics_5,1,CG,"I bought this to help me with the shipping and it works great.

The only downside is that it's very small.

I bought the TRS-80A as a replacement for my older model. "
Electronics_5,5,CG,No complaints.  I am happy with the quality and sound.  I also like the fact that the cord is adjustable.  I am using it with the TRS-80 and it does not slip into the pockets.
Electronics_5,4,CG,"After reading the reviews, I decided to go with the Logitech N60 for my new laptop. It is so small that it is a must have for the first couple of weeks I use it. It is light and compact"

Electronics_5,5,CG,Quite simply this product works great. The only problem is that it takes a while to get used to. If you want to use it for a long time you'll need to get used to it. I'll just be glad

Electronics_5,5,OR,"Worked great with my USB 3 dock to give me a third monitor since I needed to change the Display Port on it to a DVI or VGA for the monitor I was using.  No issues, and can't beat this price.  Shipped quickly."
Electronics_5,1,OR,"I never actually got to use this.  It seemed to be charging fine, but after the first day, it stopped charging and is now useless.  Unfortunately the package got thrown out so now I cannot return it, but if I could, I would."
Electronics_5,4,OR,The heart rate monitor is only designed to make good contact when it's wet. So I'm not able to wear it all day to monitor continuous HR. This was disappointing as this was the primary reason for ordering. Steps do not seem to be accurate.
Electronics_5,5,OR,This is one of the draw backs of the Olympus Brand digital camera.  The XD cards are more expensive than the SD cards and made me kind of shy away from the Olympus products.  This adapter makes it very affordable for picture storage.
Electronics_5,5,OR,works perfectly. the range and sensitivity is what I expect. this product must continuously improve in quality and price. the only concern i have is the screw they use is so soft and easily dugged out by strong screw driver. overall this is highly recommendable.
Electronics_5,4,OR,"Sound is good, call quality is great as long as you're not out in windy conditions.  Battery life is good.  Very comfortable.  Controls could be a little easier to identify, but they all work great with a Galaxy S5.  Very pleased."
Electronics_5,5,OR,I use my Nikon D7100 with 70-200mm Nikon lens regularly and find this holster works extremely well!  I would recommend it to anyone with a similar camera setup.  It is used frequently when photographing many High School and youth sports game year round.
Electronics_5,1,OR,The product does not work at all. Try to use it with every USB flash drive that works in all my other USB devices but to no avail. No sign of life or sign of light for any USB mass storage device connected to it.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Item shipped on time and was as described. Excellent customer service. This product works great and is what I needed. My old cord for my external hard drive, the wires were sticking out had to replace it with this one. I highly recommend this product."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I think these headphones are a pretty good deal, considering the low cost.  The blue LED doesn't really bother me at all and I think that having a volume control built into the cord is a great feature.  I'm very satisfied with them."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Quality items.  I bought these for modding my PS3 60GB PHAT model along with a 120mm fan, to allow more air flow since those original models get hot and the internal fan sounds like a jet engine at highest RPM.

Great seller, and excellent product."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Great case and great quality. I've used this case for over a year now and it hasn't had any problems. The quality is wonderful and I've gotten quite a few compliments on it. It's slim, sleek and doesn't make the tablet bulky. Highly reccomend it."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"It's a little bulky, but it is great in protecting the Kindle Fire.  I love the fact that you can easily rotate the kindle and use the case as a stand.  The magnetic closure is fantastic and makes the product easy to use."

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"All snails arrived alive and well, been in my tank for 4 days now. took a couple snails a day or so to become active but happy with purchase."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,my cats stay off my furniture and stay off for quite some time when i put the Ssscat on. I just wish it would last longer.
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,I have dogs and cats that both drink out of the same fountain. My girl cat is really picky so I know these filters work. We buy these regularly.
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,Hamster loved them. Even gave a few to my cockatiel who pecked at them as well. Good price when you do this as an add-on to a bigger order.

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,Very cute will buy again I liked how they shipped fast and they are delicate with the clothes nice soft material good company I will recommend buying from them.
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"these are awesome, dogs love them and the size is not to small not to big. The perfect size treat for any size dog. Which makes them very economical."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,I have a Rottweiler we are treating for heartworm. We are having to keep a high energy dog calm 24/7 and this seems to be having the most impact.
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,.my older car (6 yrs) loves it.  i find it is now his don't touch me i'm eating food.  my younger cat likrs the chicken chunks meals.
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,This is wonderful for the backseat of our Chevy Cruze and two Toy Fox Terriers. The price is much better than the Snoozer brand I have in our CRV.
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"Perfect size for my growing pacman frog. He's only a few months old but he loves his new pool. Will likely fit fine as an adult, but we'll see"
Pet_Supplies_5,2,OR,"The X-L does not even fit over my dogs head - the sizing is extremely small and had to return.
On the positive side, the fabric and quality was beautiful."

 the fountain..."
Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"My betta doesn't use it, but I don't think that it is a reflection on the quality of the product. It is bendable and nice looking. Serves its purpose."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"Marineland must've moved on to a newer model tank, so I can't get these filters in the pet store anymore. I'm glad I found them for a good price!"
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"I have a kitty who is a chewer. Did I mention she's a chewer? Since I put this out for her, she's not chewed on anything else."

Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"Fits my lab/American bull dog mix perfect, size L. Is definitely not a no-pull harness though. Probably helps him pull more. Great harness though, for those dogs trained well."
Pet_Supplies_5,1,OR,"Flimsy, thin, cheap looking and feeling, bad chemical laden smell prior to washing before I would put it anywhere near my dog. I am discarding it. Waste of money."
Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"I received a used leash, but i still like it. The brass had some scratches, the handle was a tad dirty, and there was some black fur on it."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,My Pekinese wasn't too happy after the 3rd bark.  Shut him down really fast.  So he's good for 2 barks and knows what happens after the 3rd.
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,My cat goes nuts for duck. Glad we were able to find a good brand and the type he liked. Plus nice that it's available via subscribe and save.
Pet_Supplies_5,2,OR,"This is not the ""bendable"" soft bone like the other one this company sells. My dog goes nuts for the bendable one thats minty. This one, she won't touch."

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,very nice but a little stiff.  been spending some time with hand lotion & elbow grease trying to soften it up.  looks real good on my puppy
Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,My kitten pretty much ignores it. I know catnip doesn't affect cats til they are older so I will just reintroduce the toy to her when she is grown.
Pet_Supplies_5,3,OR,I bought this because my old clippers were not cutting the nail cleanly. It kind of left the nail ragged. This one is the same as my old pair.
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,My little Yorkie loves this toy. She plays with it for the longest each time. In fact we have already replaced the batteries in it once..would definitely buy again.
Pet_Supplies_5,5,CG,color is really nice. well made. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to put on.  I had to replace it.

Pet_Supplies_5,5,CG,"The dogs love them and, if they are ever fed these, they will turn up the odor and chase them all over the house."
Pet_Supplies_5,1,CG,"It did not work at all. The only problem is that it did not work at all. The other two I had it for, both of which"
Pet_Supplies_5,5,CG,Works great on my dog. She is an aggressive chewer and will turn her nose up at anything she gets in the dish.

Pet_Supplies_5,5,CG,"My best friend, Sherman, a male lab, was very picky about her treats. She was one of the first to say, ""I love"

Pet_Supplies_5,5,CG,"I have a very picky eater. She eats her food in her bowl, but this one is a little too heavy for her."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,CG,"Admittedly I bought these for my puppy, she's a small dog and my 2 small dogs just can't get enough of them."
Pet_Supplies_5,3,CG,I ordered two and only one of them came out. I will not be buying the other one.I bought this for a friend's cat and she
Pet_Supplies_5,5,CG,Great filter. I bought the small size and the medium size. My cats love it!Very nice.I bought this for a friend's cat and
Pet_Supplies_5,2,CG,"It technically fits the small, but the medium is just too big.

The sizing chart is a bit misleading. The size of the collar is"
Pet_Supplies_5,2,CG,My pets loved it. they would eat it and play with it for a while. the cats were just starting to get used to it.
Pet_Supplies_5,3,CG,"Nice looking, but my cats are not impressed with it. I will keep this for the next couple of months.My dogs love this food. "
Pet_Supplies_5,5,CG,"It does a great job keeping my puppy busy and comfortable.

If you have a dog who is prone to the pain of a scratching post,"
Pet_Supplies_5,5,CG,This is working out great.  The only problem is that it's kind of hard to put the bottom on top.  I wish it was made
Pet_Supplies_5,5,CG,"Excellent quality for the price.  I have bought many other brands of pet collars, but this is the one I had the most trouble with."
Pet_Supplies_5,1,CG,way to flimsy. It bends and has a wide opening. I will not be buying this again. Great product. Great price.
Pet_Supplies_5,5,CG,This is the third doggy collar I have bought and it is a nice fit for the size of the collar. The collar is also a bit small
Pet_Supplies_5,5,CG,The fish loved it before it broke and the fish just loved it.My dog loves this treat.I bought this for a friend who has a small

Pet_Supplies_5,5,CG,I can tell the little ticks have been removed and they are now back to normal. I just hope that this keeps the ticks away from my dog and
Pet_Supplies_5,5,CG,Dig this Kong. My dogs go crazy over it.Very good quality. My dogs love this one.I bought this for a friend's cat and
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"I have this sitting in a bucket which I use to circulate clweaner then sanitizer, then water through the three lines on my beer tap system. Quiet and works well."
Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,I have used Wellness Core products for over 10 years.  My rotties have lived fairly long and healthy lives.  My last girl lived to be 14 years old.
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,Nice leash with comfortable handle. The leash itself is a little more lightweight than I would've liked but my dog is not really a puller so it will be fine.
Pet_Supplies_5,1,OR,My dog hates it... it's too big to fit into the back of his mouth to get to his rear molars. He takes off running every time he sees it.
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,I bought this as a second filter for my 40 gallon RES tank... it has made quite a difference! I think it works better than the other brands canister filter!
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,I am having a little problem with my pet. She has to use it. She is still trying to jump up into the truck. My husband and l thank you.
Pet_Supplies_5,1,OR,"Did not work, ultimately found its way to the garage. Pieces seem to be made cheaply and did not fit on any of my filters."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"If you have pets this is a great product.  I clean ears, eyes, cuts, etc.  Very gentle and effective.  Not for serious wounds .... see the vet."
Pet_Supplies_5,2,OR,"Probably best for smaller dogs. The mesh and straps are very lightweight and seem comfortable, but my dog is 70 lbs and this harness didn't keep him from pulling much!"
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"She loves them. When she hears one rattle, her little ears perk up and she's ready to go after it. She has us laughing with her antics with these toys."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"I personally have not tried this but my dogs seem to love this stuff. Of course, they will eat dead rats and rocks so the recommendation has a limited reach."

Books_5,5,OR,I loved this book. The characters were well developed. The dialogue in the book was snappy. The protagonist in the book was funny and interesting. There was continuous drama throughout the story. Easy to visualize.
Books_5,3,OR,Very disappointing and not worth what it cost.  Didn't really say anything.  Suggest the authors take their own advice and quit.  Pleasant enough to read for the very short time it occupied.
Books_5,5,OR,"Couldn't be any better!  A terrific book.  Something happening every page.  One book that is hard to put down.  Love the ""Prey"" books.  I've read them all up to #25."
Books_5,5,OR,"I absolutely adore this collection. It is Mark Twain at his most clever and fun level of prowess. If you like his novels, you must experience his short stories. Almost every one is a joy."
Books_5,5,OR,"Not a kids' book, but very interesting read.  You have to suspend disbelief for the initial event, but otherwise everything follows naturally. The construction of the story (alternating viewpoints) makes you want--NEED--to keep reading!"
Books_5,5,OR,I couldn't put the book down once I started it.  I always look forward to reading one of his books.  The characters are well thought out and this one was a page turner.
Books_5,5,OR,Fantastic! Contains all their recipes. Also has the history of how the Salt Lick came about. I have eaten there many times. It is probably a 5 Star BBQ Restaurant in the Austn TX area.
Books_5,5,OR,"BK#3 in Martin's fantasy masterpiece SONG OF ICE AND FIRE. The best fantasy series ever written. No nerdy magic malarky or talking animals. Just grand, gritty, realistic, adventure writing. And don't forget the HBO series"

Books_5,5,OR,"AUDIO book: Engrossing true story. Especially for us living in OKC. The narrator, deserves special recognition. I can't decide if she was overacting; hated the mostly whisprey dialoge, or if she really had a great story-teller voice."
Books_5,3,OR,Fascinating glimpse into the life of a courtesan.  More than I wanted to know.  Much too long in the early narrative.  Mother daughter dynamics very interesting.  Also Chinese men's attitude s and thinking.

Books_5,4,OR,"It showed how people saw Hitler's Germany at that time.  I thought it should have more history and less novel.  It could happen in our country, if we don't wake up to what is happening here!"

Books_5,5,OR,One of the best books ever written. Kline managed to incorporate so many pop culture references from the 1980s into this book that I was stunned. It's also a perfect photograph of the internet in the late 1990s.
Books_5,5,OR,The Guardians Trilogy was a decent series. Nora Roberts has a gift of weaving her tales into stories. These are no different. They are a nice break from my usual serious thrillers and suspense. I enjoy Nora Roberts.

Books_5,5,OR,"This book was very hard to take in, considering the subject matter.  The 'experiments' conducted on people of color, prisoners and the poor, highlights why there is so much distrust of the medical profession and our government."
Books_5,5,OR,19C Russian literature at its best. Great e-book version. Easy to locate by chapter or last page read. This is a large book that doesn't fit in your pocket or purse - great on my Samsung Galaxy 5.
Books_5,4,OR,"Turns out to be a long yarn and perhaps a bit too fictitious for my tastes, but then when you write a novel you have to have extra ordinary stuff or the plot begins to fade from interest."

Books_5,2,OR,This book is way too long and confusing. It has too many characters and some characters have similar names which makes it even more confusing. It's neither a mystery or a ghost story like it's been described. I just don't understand how it won  the Booker prize.

Books_5,4,OR,"Trying to read ""the classics"" I'd pnly read from Comic books, and this was a good but tough read. Language so different from how we speak today and much more ""science"" than I'd anticipated, even though not completely correct with what we know today, but still a good read."

I had a lot of fun with this book and think the same thing about the book.  It is a good read, and one I would"
Books_5,3,OR,"This is  an enjoyable short story.  Written in 1999,  it is one of the first books to introduce us to the world of Harmony.  I only gave it 3 stars because of its length.  Jayne Castle is an excellent author and I do recommend the book."
Books_5,5,OR,Ms Binchy expresses in the simplest of terms ... The humanness of the ordinary person. It's a fragile embrace that this writer bestows on each character. In a few short words she creates a bond between readers and her characters. She's a lovely writer who seamlessly brings ideals to the forefront.
Books_5,5,OR,"After downloading about 7 different samples, I've settled on this version.  It updates and corrects punctuation in the standard public domain version, and maintains standard paragraph spacing.  It also conveniently links events in the novel to a map of London.

Only limitation: I wish it also annotated primary contemporary references."
Books_5,5,OR,I received this paperback on loan from a friend. I really enjoyed this second book of the series-- much better than the first which sometimes mired me down in world-building. Red Plague offered another great plot and I continued to enjoy the friendships between each of the characters.
Books_5,5,OR,"I just finished this. I have always been fascinated by the Ice Age era. As an avid hunter and outdoors-man, I noticed a few things that didn't seem plausible- not enough to detract from the story. Just started the 2nd of the series, hope it is as good as the first."
Books_5,4,OR,"For anyone who has some minimal knowledge about finances this is very easy to read and does provide practical, approachable things anyone can do.  You don't need a lot of money to retire if you understand what truly makes you happy and how really inexpensive and fun it can be."
Books_5,4,OR,"This was a great read. Not too smutty, a wonderful path of complication to keep things interesting. I do think the build up to the ""Judah"" situation was a bit much for the outcome, but it didn't kill the book. I still liked it, in fact I couldn't put it down."
Books_5,5,OR,"This is simply one of the best rock n' roll biographies I've ever read.  It reads like a novel, not the usual dry biographical documentary.  If you like U2, or if you just want to read a really good book with interesting characters, this is the book for you!"
Books_5,5,OR,"This was another one of Stuart Woods' Stone Barrington novels that once I reached the half way point I could not put down.  It was easy to picture the action in my mind as I read each chapter, particularly the last half of the book.  It really came alive."
Books_5,5,OR,"Excellent addition to the series. If you're interested in a modern day setting with wizards, magic, and monsters, I strongly suggest that you pick up book #1, Storm Front (The Dresden Files, Book 1). You will quickly end up back to this book, and the characters will be very well developed."
Books_5,3,OR,"Been a Koontz fan for a long time, but his stories have changed over time.  Breathless could hardly be labeled a thriller, or even suspense.  I like his characters, but this one left me kind of disappointed.  I enjoy when he adds the dogs to his stories, tho."
Books_5,5,OR,"This book is a ""must read."" The main character, Taylor and her friend Lou ann are true to their country upbringing. They are funny and Taylor is very wise. When she is handed a baby, she becomes a wonderful mother, but names the baby Turtle. Wonderful read. Thank you, Barbara kingslover."
Books_5,5,OR,"Bought this for someone's husband who works long hours and can not take English classes.  Seeing the pictures and the word in one's native language, helps build vocabulary in English.  I teach ESL and have found all the picture dictionaries a very helpful tool, especially with the beginning student."
Books_5,5,OR,"Per Niccol&ograve; Machiavelli, we are invited to distribute his works after his death. This order's books are all well bound softcover full wrapped editions. Good gifts for the symbolic gesture but the full e-version of the same title in previous review is the edition necessary for scheming laughs and academic research."

Books_5,5,OR,"This book is likely to make many people very uncomfortable, but I think it's a great alternative version of what is taught in mainstream Christianity.  Mary is brought to life as an individual with weaknesses and foibles, and a historical reality that makes a lot more sense than generally (blindly) accepted."
Books_5,4,OR,"Good introduction to behavioral economics, I suppose, but it's also kind of a review of the author's career. He does take you through the major theories in the field and explain the basic in the field. Not super technical so worthwhile for  variety of audiences from managers to serious economic students."
Books_5,5,OR,"Interesting characters, unusual crime with lots of twists. When original rare manuscripts are stolen from a university the first crime takes place.  The insurance company insuring the manuscripts and the FBI go to work to solve the case. Loved the book and so glad Grisham is back to his good writing."
Books_5,5,OR,I read this book years ago and I still find myself talking about it and recommending to friends. It is a wonderful story and reminds us that not everyone sat by and did nothing during the holacaust. Many people risked their lives to do the right thing. I recommend this book highly.
Books_5,5,OR,"A great book, much more detail than the film.
A very sad but true story.

Philomena was very gracious about her story, there must be a lot of children out there looking for their birth mothers.
Shame on the church , let's hope lessons have been learnt."
Books_5,5,OR,"All three of these books were written by Linda Lael Miller and I would say that all of them were very good books.  I have read the rest of the books in the series and they have also been good.
I would recommend this author to anyone who likes cowboy romance books."
Books_5,5,OR,This is a surprisingly engaging story.  Nicely crafted.  For the years I spent in Pocock boat it never occurred to me that there was a person by that name.  The book took me back to the boat and the feeling of a proper set on still water at dawn.
Books_5,4,OR,Each one in the series just gets better.  A wonderful  escape from the doom and gloom headlines of every day life.  Ladybug Farm is a seven book series and I already know I'll be suffering separation anxiety when I'm done with them all.  Off to the next one:)

Books_5,4,OR,"This is the first book by Ann Leckie I have read, and I really enjoyed it.

Just what I want out of science fiction. Highly recommended."
Books_5,5,OR,"How do you tie up a 18 book series?!

Books_5,5,CG,"Ignore the pathetic attacks below, it's time to stop saying ""oh my god, what happened to the two girls?"" The reader must know that the reader is not in a position to make an educated opinion on the issue. I am not saying the book should"
Books_5,4,CG,"Much of the book was written in the early 60s, but I enjoyed it very much. The story is told from the point of view of the heroine, who is a strong and determined young woman. It was a very interesting story."

Books_5,5,OR,An engaging tale that parallels outcomes we might see today. Hard to put down and easy to get into. If there is any criticism it is that details were too deeply researched resulting in a few sections that continued beyond the sale. But in the end that made it all the more believable.
Books_5,5,OR,"I liked the story.  I thought it was well written, even though I was confused in the beginning about who was talking in each chapter.  It gets clearer as you get to know the characters.  I liked the twists, the characters, the beginning and the end.  Very good read."
Books_5,5,OR,Excellent book.  Well written but disturbing.  Fortunately we have progressed somewhat in our thinking and practices but there is a great deal more to be done.  The right to privacy and the authority over what is done with our tissue and organs should be the absolute right of the patient.
Books_5,3,OR,"Don't waste your time with this one.  With all the good books out there to be reading there is really no reason to waste your time with this mediocre outing.  The main character is dull, the story is predictable, the plot is weak, and all in all a waste of time."
Books_5,5,OR,This is a rivetting book and hard to put down.  It would make a great motion picture.  Not only is the story compelling but I learned so much about art restoration.  The book is very well researched. There are a number of emotional issues which are well drawn.  Kudos.
Books_5,3,OR,"Stories were outstanding, especially for a contemporary of that era which I am. Book was in rough condition when received.

Books_5,4,OR,Part of a series this romance has everything fans of the genre could ask for. I will be watching for deals on the rest of the series. One sex scene (no gratuitous descriptions but slightly more detail then a kiss and a door closing) and pretty clean the rest of the way through.
Books_5,4,OR,Syn is all man....the story line made me angry with shar but it really was a great read....interesting. Read the preview of the book before purchasing. If it grabs you purchase one and read and then decide if you want to continue.  This is the only way you would appreciate the book.
Books_5,3,OR,"Oh how this would have benefited from editing to reduce the detail, add more action and lower the page count. I had to take a break after Part Two and read another book before returning to Part Three. I did want to know how it ended but it was a chore to finish."
Books_5,5,OR,I really loved this first book in the series. Tris is a true Hero and I love the chemistry that her and Four had. The story line gripped me and didn't let go. I was filled with action with a bit of romance. I cant wait to read the rest of the series.
Books_5,4,OR,"Dick is the master of the sleight of hand, defying reality with his novels and short stories.  Plus, like all great sci fi, or speculative fiction, he creates a ""real"" world with ""real"" people and yet somehow makes the reader keep turning those pages.  A great read, by a great story-teller."
Books_5,4,OR,I enjoyed reading this book. The very original plot unfolds on the background of a fascinating hypothesis: the conscience as result of quantum processes in the brain cells. At the end of the book you can find a very complete and well-organized list of readings to further investigate the theory of quantum consciusness.
Books_5,3,OR,"It started out really well and peak my imagination right away, but it went on and on about her imaginary boyfriend and just skimmed the surface of her being a witch. I found Jane's relationship with David and Neko more interesting and fun and wanted more of those then all her other ones."
Books_5,3,OR,"I thought this book was better than Shopaholic to the Stars because it was a road trip through the beautiful western part of our country. Yes, some of the plots were stupid, especially the Vegas wedding scene. Is it as good as the first few in the series-no; it isn't the worst either."

Books_5,2,OR,"I was embarrassed when this book arrived and I realized that I had just purchased a dressed up romance novel. The premise sounded great, but it is only a front. Niffenegger is painfully self indulgent. This would be great as a guilty pleasure for someone who can stomach it, but the write-ups are misleading."
Books_5,5,OR,"This bas a gift.  I heard that is was received well and that my grandson will soon be immersed in the folklore of the middle east.  In the current social climate that may not be the best idea, but certainly the Arabian Nights have become interwoven into our Western culture as well."

Books_5,5,OR,"I love books that have a plausible yet fantastic concept, something that can't happen but you can see the possibility.

Books_5,2,OR,"It is funny, yes and lots of the usual social wit. His use of words and ideas are wonderful and you marvel at his genius but the story is hard to find.  I'll never toss out a Pratchett's book but with this one I'd recommend making long, guiltless hops through sections when needed."

Books_5,4,OR,But only at moments. There was also an engaging story- at moments. This story of the events  in a marriage from two different perspectives is unevenly written. You have to be willing to overlook the writing from the opening line; the first but hardly the last incomplete sentence. And Cormac McCarthy she is not.
Books_5,4,OR,"Even better because rooted in historical fact and a real lust for science.  But better than some other MC books was the richness and depth of the characters, their experiences and context.  I got lost in this book. An excellent read!  Thanks to the family for bringing this terrific story to life."
Books_5,5,OR,"This is my first Lorna Landvik book and I thought it was charming!  Written all in e-mails, it takes a while to sort out who's who, but once I started it, didn't put it down until I finished it!  (Fortunately, it was a short book!).  Will definitely be reading more of Landvik!"
Books_5,5,OR,"It's been a long time since a book made me cry, and the first time it made me cry both in horror and in joy. It's not an easy read, but like many books that make you work a bit, it's rewarding and I think you will never forget it. Read it if you dare."
Books_5,4,OR,"I read this book for the first time in the late 90s. It was if it were brand new to me.  And, like any good book, I didn't want to put it down. Great and enjoyable way to re familiarize yourself with the characters before reading any of  Jan Karon's books that follow."
Books_5,4,OR,It's a long read but it's so gripping you'll fly through pretty fast. The characters of the town is what makes this such a good book. You'll be feeling for them all by the end. Just like with all of King's books there is some graphic content but for adults it shouldn't be a problem.
Books_5,4,OR,I read this book because I was really interested in how this religion worked was craziness they were meant to believe. I was sad that at 15 she was force to marry still a child and what she had to adorn and what she had to leave behind when she finally wanted to get out
Books_5,5,OR,"This is one of the best books I've read. Full of adventure, you ache with tragedy, and cry in the good parts. But it's light, the bad things not overdone in gross detail, just enough to pull the emotion of the reader. This is a book to be proud to have on your shelf."
Books_5,2,OR,I chose this on a recommendation from a reliable friend. In the beginning I had hope this book would become more likable.  I trudged through to the end.  I could not identify with any of the characters.  I was not sympathetic to any of the main characters.  Don't waste your time.
Books_5,5,OR,"There is nothing to say really, just look at the photos. The more one knows about Leibovitz's life and career, the more depth the photos take on. I bought this book for a present and I had so much trouble parting with it I bought a second one for myself. She is a master. Period."
Books_5,5,OR,"I am sure the Harry Bosch saga is just the best crime fiction ever. Gripping, fast moving, constantly exciting. Connelly ups his game with every book. I love the fact that his character Bosch is deeply honest and moral. The cherry on the cake is that Bosch cares - ""everybody counts or no-one does"" Excellent!"
Books_5,4,OR,"I really enjoyed REVENGE of the WROUGHT-IRON FLAMINGOS, enough that I have recommended, not only this book, but the series to others. I literally found myself guffawing outloud during the scene where the murderer is caught. The series is a good read for those who like mystery, a little romance and a lot of laughs."
Books_5,5,CG,"From starting the first book, I couldn't put it down.  This is the first book in a series that I've read, and I am excited to read more of these characters.  They are all so well written, and they make for a very enjoyable read.
"
Books_5,4,CG,how does one rate this?  I don't know.  But I did like the way he described the two stories.  I liked how they both seemed to have a great chemistry.  I think it's because of the historical background that it's hard to see how they
Books_5,5,CG,I love Stephanie Plum and this book kept me engaged. I will keep my eyes peeled for the next book.I had to read this book to get through the first half of it. The story was well told and the characters were well developed. I would recommend this to everyone.
Books_5,3,CG,"I know that these books are an easy read, and I will admit that I have been tempted to finish them.  The first half of the book is a bit predictable, and it's worth it.  It's a fairly short story about two women with an interesting relationship."
Books_5,5,CG,"Having been very young and not an academic, I have heard a lot of great things about the book.  I had heard the story before and thought the book was a great read.  I was sad when I saw the cover, but it was a very good story.

Books_5,5,CG,"Excellent. Meticulously researched and carefully written. The author has a good grasp on how to use the data.I read this book in the middle of the night, and it was great.  The story was well told and the characters were strong.  I would recommend this"
Books_5,1,CG,"Agree with the first reviewer. I liked the way it was written. The characters were well developed. The story was interesting, but also very different than the first book in the series. I found myself in the middle of the story."
Books_5,3,CG,"A really cute story, lovely characters, and an interesting plot. The story starts out pretty slow. The story starts out a bit slow but the pace goes up and up as the story progresses. It was good to get the pace down a bit."
Books_5,5,CG,"This is the classic touchstone of the story, which is its history, its characters, and its story's consequences. The reader must know that the reader is not only a reader, but also a reader's historian.

Books_5,1,CG,"Hackneyed and derivative, this book is an easy read and a good read.

The premise of the story is simple enough: the most powerful man in the world, the great ruler of the world, is in the process of using a secret force to hold him hostage"
Books_5,1,CG,This book gives me hope!  I love the writing style of this book!  I am starting to get tired of the repetitive details of the story and the beginning of the story.  The story is well told and the ending is a bit predictable.  This is a great
Books_5,5,CG,"This book is so very good.  It's a good history book for a beginner.  It is so informative.  I am a big fan of the ""War of the Worlds"" series.  It is a good historical book for a beginner.  It is very good"
Books_5,5,OR,"This is a good beginning textbook.  It is still being used in an online college where I tutor even though there are several more recent
editions.  I actually now have 3 different editions for different colleges and find them mostly the same.  Certainly if you want a book for personal use, this a bargain."
Books_5,5,OR,"I bought this book for my husband.  He works for a woman.  This book had great insight plus he enjoyed it.  A must read for all..upper management or those who are just starting out.  It doesn't matter if you are male or female....there is something for everyone.  Good for bosses, too."
Books_5,5,OR,"I didn't realize that it was a CD when I bought it, but I had heard such good reviews from my pen pal I just had to get it to check it out.
Tao of Pooh was a great read, I'm still trying to understand this on another level. Over all though, I don't regret buying it."
Books_5,5,OR,I loved this book. I've read a lot of the books on grain brain and paleo-type lifestyles. This was one of my favourites because it was so easy to read and presented the most compelling research. Dr Perlmutter makes it very hard to dispute that grains are not great for our bodies. Definitely worth a read.
Books_5,1,OR,This book was boring as all get out....from beginning to end BORING...I couldn't take it anymore after chapter 9 I had to skip to chapter 20 and sure enough more ridiculous boring writing...and I'm not sure what others are reading but this book is no way romantic.... it's a tragedy story...true sad but not heart wrenching...
Books_5,5,OR,"Girls (3 and 5) LOVE these books. This one is very detail oriented and they love the pictures. I was actually surprised at how long it was! We also have the Narnia book and it is much shorter (one small paragraph per page), so I was quite impressed with the length of this one! Definitely recommend."
Books_5,5,OR,"This book is a classic, and the 30th Anniversary Edition maintains all of the aspects I have grown to love about Shel Silverstein's books. The poems are fun and quirky, catchy and meaningful. The illustrations provide comical relief throughout the entirety of the poems. This book is sure to please across all ages, races, and sexes."
Books_5,2,OR,"Granted I'm not really a mystery person and my apology to those who really liked this book but I thought it was choppy, confusing, and not worth finishing. The introduction of new characters was not smooth at all, the segue between Germany and Lisbon had too many gaps. The unfinished tome will sit in my Kindle."
Books_5,4,OR,"Lots of good info on the USA-USSR crypto war, quite a bit of cold-war politics mixed in for understanding some of the technical issues.  It is a long book and I found it was best to read and at appropriate points take a break with another book and then come back to resume this one."
Books_5,4,OR,"This book is laugh out loud funny.  The simple drawings add wonderful,  ridiculous understanding of the events being described in Allie Brosh's unique voice.  One of the most poignant descriptions of what it is like for a brilliant mind to be haunted by depression.  She still manages to make the subject entertaining."
Books_5,4,OR,"I both loved and hated this book.  I guess that is what makes it a classic.  The character development is great, you feel like you know these people.  I really don't know why the book is named Anna Karenia because I really wanted to keep getting to the parts about Kitty and Levin."
Books_5,4,OR,"A nice, semi-sweet but also a bit surprising story of a young werewolf woman torn between love of a human and duty to her pack. Not quite your typical romance, I really enjoyed this coming of age story that had a decent (but not over-the-top) amount of angst, and an enjoyable ending (without being utterly predictable)."
Books_5,4,OR,"Very slow start. I had a hard time getting into it until about 60-70 pages in. After the initial ""slow"" pages, it picked up and I enjoyed the story. Some parts of the ending were foreshadowed early on in the book, but the major plot twist at the end I did not see coming."
Books_5,3,CG,"I purchased this book based on an article by John Grisham.  He provided a couple of other reviews.  The reader will find that the author was not a great writer and that it was difficult to follow the plot in a story.  This book is excellent.

"
Books_5,4,CG,"This is an interesting take on a family with a history of its own that is well worth the time.  The story is told from a family member's point of view, and it is written in a way that leaves the reader feeling as though the reader is reading a novel. "

Books_5,5,OR,I had a Les Brown Tape of this Book years ago. I wore that tape out listening to it. I could quote passages from it and still remember it today. I loved his humor and inspiration. I garnered so much enthusiasm from Les!  One of the most inspirational person that I admire next to Tony Robbins.
Books_5,5,OR,"The book is for an Art History class I am taking for self-improvement.
It is in great 'used' condition; I did not want to pay the price for a new one.
Thanks, amazon, for making it available to me.
The art work in this book is what I will be seeing when I go to Paris & London next month!"
Books_5,5,OR,"Cheryl Strayed's book is at once lyrical, poetic, concise and brutally honest, much like the trail she hikes.

Though toward the end she seems to lose the charming self-deprecation of the first 2/3 of the book, the way she wraps up the book---what every reader waits for---makes every part of taking her journey worth it, and worth discussing."
Books_5,4,OR,"I have re-read this book several times, it was a really neat story. I bought this as a Kindle daily deal and loved the characters so much I bought the rest of the books in the series. This was an original story line with some great little twists. Sophia James has a hit with these 4 books."
Books_5,3,OR,"I found that i got hung up on what i preceived to be a lot of historical inaccuracies rather than enjoy the story. Only to discover that at the end, the author explained all of it in the author notes. It would have been a more enjoyable read had those been at the beginning of the book."
Books_5,2,OR,I was so looking forward to this book.  I love the series and couldn't wait for this book to come.  I'm not going to spoil it for those who decide to pay this outrageous price for this book.  This book was seriously lacking from her other novels.  If not just down right boring.
Books_5,4,OR,"By no means is this a great literary work, however, that said, I found it to be a satisfying autobiography in the Horatio Alger vein and an easy read.  Mr. Brown's life achievements to date are to be appreciated and he has recorded them in great detail and with pride, to which he is properly entitled."
Books_5,4,OR,This book was a great read!  Cool inside look into the secret service.  I always wondered what they have to deal with.  They see everything and have to be so neutral and give up so much!  Very interesting wish  there was more on the current players but understand why that is impossible.
Books_5,5,OR,"Excellent work. Just a note on the other negative review on this item: It is regarding a Hungarian translation, which is not this edition. Amazon links reviews together and sometimes the review under a certain product is not actually for that product. This is one of those instances. Don't let it discourage you from a great read."
Books_5,5,OR,"My favorite book in the last few years.  The author's  language skills carry us through a number of traumatic and sensitive events, often allowing us  to see into the very soul of the main, and very real, characters, which I find both unsettling and unbelievably touching.  I'm anxiously awaiting Mr. Henderson's next book."
Books_5,3,OR,"This is the second book by Patchett that I have read. State of Wonder being the first. The author pulls you in to both books, beautifully written, and both have a very abrupt ending. I have to say I am disappointed once again with her books, she tells some great stories and leaves the reade hanging ."
Books_5,4,OR,"I found 'My Life in France' an absolutely delightful read.  Julia Child's personality shines throughout the text and you feel as though you really get to know Paul and Julia Child.  ..... very absorbing and a wonderful account of not only their time in France, but also the great relationship between the two of them."

Books_5,5,CG,This is not a travelogue. The author describes a few moments from her travels in order to share a few stories. The reader will also enjoy the descriptions of the environments of the cities and the people living there. The book was enjoyable. I enjoyed reading it.
Books_5,1,CG,"I was a longtime fan of the original series and decided to read this one. I was disappointed.

I had to read the first book in the series, so it was a little difficult to get into. I found it a bit predictable. I liked the setting and the characters."

Books_5,5,OR,"While this story of a poor American boy inheriting a British title is a bit dated, it's still powerful.

The nasty old Earl changes under the influence of his good and strong American grandson. Watch also for a great David O Selznick 1930s version of this minor classic.  Had a lot of A list actors and supporting actors."
Books_5,2,OR,"I have just started this book and hope I don't have to read too many graphic autopsy reports.  I didn't read The Surgeon but found I didn't have to as this book so far has made numerous references to it.

It seems most of these stories are written by women and always have female M.E.s doing the autopsies?"
Books_5,4,OR,"I don't love it.

The writing is a bit convoluted at times and somehow, (maybe this should be good), it seems more like fiction than a real story. When I pick it up, I enjoy it but I don't feel compelled to pick it up.

I do believe the author did an incredible amount of work to write it ..."
Books_5,5,OR,"Cute little version for you and your children reading time!  I bought this one for my daughter's baby shower,
a part of a nice gift basket I made for her.  When she saw it she cried of emotion because I used to read the
same story to her when she was little and she loved it very much!"
Books_5,5,OR,"thank you, Mr. Grisham, for the realistic portrayal of a child torn apart and manipulated not only by the mob but by the federal government.  it just goes to show that us kids are still the most vunerable in life.  scary for  me as a young girl, but exciting and eloquent.  again, thank you."
Books_5,4,OR,"The Rich are Different entertained me during a long, transcontinental flight. The book is rich with interesting characters, entertaining situations,set in attractive and historic locations. Like a potboiler, one roots for the heroine and relishes hating the bad guys. Howatch gets full credit for imaginative characters one can admire while recognizing that they are deeply flawed as well."
Books_5,3,OR,"I have all the Honor series and this is the book I like least.  Author seems to have run out of fresh ideas.  In fact, there were parts of the book where I was sure I had read in previous books.  Story line started out good but sort of faded out as the book porgressed"
Books_5,4,OR,"Grab a glass of wine and a cozy chair, this is a good read. Seeing Jake Brigance again was fun, even though he does have a bit too much swagger at times.  Grisham's stories are like old slippers, comfortable and always welcome.  Sycamore Row is solid, not flashy, but I enjoyed it immensely. Relax and enjoy."
Books_5,3,OR,I enjoyed reading this book as I was learning about some things I knew little about. The relationships and personalities of each sister and their reactions to their mothers hoarding. How the generations kept up the hoarding. The reasons behind the need for this way of life. The difficulties and broken families that result all were presented well.
Books_5,5,OR,"Yea, pretty basic stuff I guess. I wish I had this info presented to me so organized and clear when I was a teen. I can't even fathom the pain and suffering I could have avoided. A great gift for any young person who matters in your life. Most adults could learn a thing or two as well."
Books_5,5,OR,What a book i loved it my second favourite next to Rainbow Six by Tom Clancy.  I tore throught hat book so quick it was that good.  you read twice as fast and it doesn't exactly follow the movie.  I think it's better  then the movie.  Any way read this book it's great.

I have picked up several more books by Jojo Moyes to read in the immediate future.  I always appreciate finding an author I enjoy reading."
Books_5,4,OR,"Actually I don't remember any sexual content, perhaps some innuendo.  This book is highly entertaining.  It is the third in a series about an Indian private detective named Vish Puri.  The first book is ""The Case of the Missing Servant"".  One very serious event in Indian/Pakistani history, the Partition, plays a part in the story."
Books_5,1,OR,"I need to separate the story (love DL Sayers) and the presentation.  This book is nowhere close to being presentable as formatted.  Many words or missing and no attempt has been made to edit the kindle edition to fix this issue.  Please, if you're expecting a publish-ready novel to read, DO NOT GET THE KINDLE EDITION."
Books_5,3,OR,"sorry, for me this is just getting a bit old and tired...especially with the fact that nearly all of the original characters are either dead, or mostly dead.

really enjoyed the series a great deal, but it appears that vs an ""end""...this is just going to morph into an entire new story with brand new good guys and bad guys."
Books_5,5,OR,"I didn't mean to start reading the book right away but while I was waiting for my husband I read the first page. Then the first chapter and then when I got home I snuck off into the hammock and read until it was too dark and realized all I had left undone. A compelling, smart and rewarding read."
Books_5,5,OR,"I teach with this. Many excellent selections. Pretty good on how to write about lit. Well-made sample essays on the stories and poems. I just miss the study questions - but then, having to come up with my own is a learning challenge! The price is wonderful too. Also, the book holds up well with many semesters of abuse!!!"
Books_5,2,OR,"Initially interesting and great insights but ends up being one more endless recount of the trashout days.

And still enjoy a good tale of those days. But ...."
Books_5,5,OR,"Short, concise, to the point -- PERFECT. I've been a Basecamp user for a long time (the author is the creator of Basecamp), so buying the book was a win, especially when I saw it on Mark Cuban's suggested reading list. If you have a small business or are starting one, don't do ANYTHING until you read this book."
Books_5,4,OR,"What a happy discovery the Nate Heller novels are!  Max Collins does a superb job of recreating an era, building a detective novel around historical dates, names and places.
I'm now on my third installment of this clever series,  and each one has been a superb read.
Give one a try and I can almost guarantee you'll be hooked!"
Books_5,4,OR,"This was a super fun read! Will it Winn a Pulitzer, No...Will it brighten a vacation or beach day, YES!!! This was a whimsical little read. I like different types of books, but every now and then, you want something a little silly. Some of it was a little too 'out there', but as a whole it was fun!"
Books_5,5,OR,"Number the stars is a great story of friendship and taking care of those who need help/protection. I read it with my students each year. And it brings up some great conversations about WWII, what good people need to do in the face of evil and how one person, or small group of people, can change lives of others."
Books_5,5,OR,"Scathing, dark, and raucous, ""Let's Pretend This Never Happened"" is easily my favorite in a long time.

Books_5,5,OR,"I'm a writer, and this book, this introduction to another culture, is beautifully written. There were times that I became so emotionally involved with this book that I had to put it down and do something else. It's a novel. But I believe it to be autobiographical, too. If you ever had any questions about India, this is for you."
Books_5,3,OR,"Read and enjoyed the first book ""The Breach"" so ordered up the follow-on, Ghost Country.  It proved to be only an OK read, More fantasy than science fiction. Hard to keep track of characters bouncing back and forth in time. Have not decided if I will invest in the third and last book to see how it all ends."
Books_5,5,OR,"This is a truly wonderful book. It's one that left me inspired when I first read it, and one that I have picked up and read a second and third time. Nicholls so effortlessly captures emotions, thought processes, and social intricacies that truly define the human experience. The characters are so real. I can't say enough good about One Day."
Books_5,3,OR,"I could certainly relate to the title character who's plagued by the superficiality of her new life in the ""hip"" suburbs. The author really captures the banal issues, social competition and gossipy habits of people with a little too much money and time on their hands. Fun while I was reading it, but didn't give it a second thought afterwards."
Books_5,5,OR,"I am a fan of Neil Gaiman but missed this one until I saw a Facebook post talking about it, and like that I was hooked.

Books_5,5,OR,"While this is the best romance ever, it pales in comparison to the 6 Outlander books that follow. It's clear that Diana Gabaldon does her research, as the other books are rich in historical detail. much more so that this, the first of the series that was basically her ""practice"" to see if should write a novel."

Books_5,5,OR,"Meyer has a tremendous future as a writer.  Comparisons to Cormac McCarthy are just a tad premature given that McCarthy's overall body of work is of Nobel quality (I wonder when they are going to get around to that!).  But, Meyer is well on his way to establishing a voice to be reckoned with now and in years to come."
Books_5,5,OR,"This is my favorite series of all time.  The characters are so well developed that they almost seem like friends you've known for a long time.

Books_5,4,OR,"It's a slow burn, but once it heats up this book is hard to put down. Gone Girl gives married couples something to think about and might just scare singles from getting married. It raises the question of who we are when we're with the one we love. Are we really ourselves or are we the person they want us to be."
Books_5,5,OR,"Just like everything this extraordinary writer has published, ""An Embarrassment of Riches"" is an astonishingly brilliant, insightful and thought-provoking cultural history.  I wait with hunger for his books;  fortunately they tend to be five-course dinners with dessert, brandy and  cigars afterwards. ""An Embarrassment"" is just such a literary and  historical feast. I cannot recommend Mr. Schama's books enough."

Books_5,1,OR,Obviously a case of Leigh doing most (if not all of the writing) and riding on the coatails of her husbands name recognition.

She acts like a spoiled 16 year old.

The first 100 pages were good, after that it started downhill, reached bottom, and with the ending, started to dig. It was horrible, don't waste your money. Wouldn't give it a star, but had to."
Books_5,4,OR,"Any regular reader of John Sandford will not be disappointed.  This is the usual mix of an over the top crime, a cast of funky good guys, and irreverent dialogue.  I have always found Sandford's books so well written. He is a craftsman of this genre. I enthusiastically recommend this read to the usual fans and to anyone new to this author."
Books_5,2,OR,"Another reviewer labeled this book cute. Perfectly described this book. It's like the author wrote down all the awh moments and strung them together and made a book. There is no irony, tension or questions that you don't know the answers to. It is a pleasant read. And I certainly didn't have to put my finger over any word. A predictable chick lit read."
Books_5,3,OR,"I received all five books very quickly but my problem is with the books themselves, not the sellers. All five books have the smallest print I have ever seen in a book. Even with reading glasses they are very difficult to read. Just ordered a magnifier to see if that helps. I can't imagine why they would use such small print in any book."
Books_5,5,OR,"this is the second book in the series and its just as delightful as the first... if you love the young adult genre but also love fairytales, this one will definitely be up your alley.  The characters are fun, the story will keep you engaged and the drawings at the beginning of each chapter are just lovely.  You will not be disappointed!"
Books_5,2,OR,"It's an okay take on a topical issue, but it's not particularly novel. Books on power and change by, for example, Dacher Keltner, John Kotter, and Robert Cialdini have already made many of the key points here. Sure, the examples are fresher (e.g., #MeToo and Trump), but those have also been covered in recent and more focused books that delve deeper into the details."
Books_5,4,OR,"Compelling story that weaves some Chinese folklore into the present day. Some of the big plot surprises were kind of redundant due to earlier books in the series as well as some distinct similarities to The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. I still enjoyed reading it, though. While it isn't my favorite in the series, it definitely isn't at the bottom of my list."

Books_5,5,CG,I think that Fr. Jim Butcher has the right to make this book as good as the first one. I read this book in the fall of 1999 and have enjoyed every page of it. I have had no issues with the historical background of the characters. I enjoyed the story line and the characters.

Books_5,2,OR,"UGH! I have never worked so hard to finish a book in my whole life. The base story was great but getting through the first 30% of the book was torture. So much could have been cut out.

Books_5,5,OR,"I saw this movie when I was a kid, but I never knew it was a book until I found it on Amazon. I just finished reading it to my 4 year old, and we both really enjoyed it. It is well written and exciting, but not too scary. I highly recommend it. It's a short book for adults, but a great length for children."
Books_5,4,OR,"Ferrigno has a perfect summer read here. It has action, good dialogue, off center characters and reads very fast. I would like to see Val back in  another book or two. I like a hero who is extremely tough and can hold his  own against anyone yet still has a moral code and can still fall in love."
Books_5,5,OR,"Barry shines in this ""men are from mars,"" battle of the sexes romp.  Dave Barry makes you laugh without ever once becoming mean-spirited.  If you have ever been married to a real 'guy' - or dated one - you will recognize the type from the first page on, and laugh out loud at Barry's depiction.

Reading Dave Barry on the Kindle is downright addicting!"
Books_5,5,OR,"More similar in its simplicity to a Princess of Mars than Gods/Warlord.  John Carter's son engages in search for abducted Thuvia, while he remains the prime suspect in her abduction.  Usual strange meetings and stranger neighborhoods, but this story is a little less frenentic than Gods/Warlord, and both Carthoris and Thuvia are solid characters.  Perhaps in my top 3 of Burrough's books."
Books_5,4,OR,"I am a first time reader of this author.  I judge a book to be 4 or 5 stars by the way I read it.  I mostly give out 3 stars.  I read this book from cover to cover without picking up another book.  So very good book, hope it continues.  Will go on to the 2nd book in series."
Books_5,4,OR,"Though hefty, do not be discouraged by the size of this one. Wordy, but once the hook is set you won't put this down. Strong descriptive language takes us to various locales and shows some familarity with the world's different places. Tough action, tho some of it occurs off stage. A sharp eye, educated commentary and a wicked wit, help the reader along. Very enjoyable."
Books_5,5,OR,"I was deeply moved by the reading of this play. Already familiar with the legend of Faust, yet I was completely unprepared for the emotional impact of the play and the way Marlowe chose to represent Faust. Regardless of my prior knowledge, I found myself willing a satisfactory ending with a repentant Faust. Observing the fight for a man's soul was gripping. A beautiful play."
Books_5,5,OR,"I've loved this entire series, with the last one I read always my favorite!  A topical story dealing with domestic abuse and drugs, the author has created a storyline to keep you invested in the outcome. Our heroine is dealing with an ex-husband involved in drug ring is doing everything a mother would do to keep her son away from this life and safe."
Books_5,5,OR,"I was a fan of twilight but the Host was absolutely mind blowing. The sheer eloquence of emotion almost made me feel as though I was part of the story. Absolutely wonderful. This is my second time reading it. Probably my favourite book so far. So gloriously intense and yet sentimental... makes me smile, cry, laugh, and frown every time I read. A definite must."
Books_5,5,CG,"Being a science-fiction, fantasy, and thriller fan, I'd say this book is my favorite. It has a lot of heart-warming moments, and also some of the most touching moments in the whole book. The story is a bit slow at times, and the story itself is not the best."
Books_5,5,CG,"I highly recommend this autobiography.  The author has a good grasp on how to tell a story.  If you are a reader of fiction and you have not read the book, then this book is a great way to start your own story.  This book is excellent.

Books_5,1,OR,"The works of WEB Griffin are great, I have read all his books numerous times. Trying to market abridged versions of his books is a sham. You cannot take a book normally requiring 11 or 12 CD's and condense it to 3 CD's without loosing 75% of the story line. Poor decision on the publisher's part for producing it and on Amazons part for selling it."

Books_5,3,OR,"it was ok for an hour long old time radio presentation. Don't know that I would buy it again, had I to do it over. The packaging was misleading - since Alistair Sim was pictured on the cover; I thought he would play the role of Scrooge. However, Orson Wells takes on the role and the program is really not much like the Alistair Sim movie."

Ms Cheney explains her life so openly I applaud her resilience, her honesty and her willingness to share her life. I do hope she continues on her road with recovery. So glad she has found the right medications to find normalcy and happiness. Thank you for sharing!"
Books_5,4,OR,An enjoyable look at one of America's first families.  While it primarily deals with the patriarchs it still give plenty of good information.  Being a former resident of St  Louis I like many others have my AB stories.  If you enjoyed this book I would recommend you read Under the Influence as well.  That book is more dates than this one.
Books_5,5,OR,"Start at the beginning, with this series, but definitely start.  It is a worthwhile trip!  The characterization is believable, the plot, too, and every time, hands down, the villain of the piece ends up being the one I did not want it to be!  How does she do it?  They are thought-provoking and entertaining at the same time.  A terrific series."
Books_5,5,OR,"I was very impressed with this book. The main theme is a teenage boy coming to grips with his sexuality. Unlike a lot of books in this genre it deals with much,much more. Brothers who wonder what happened to their closeness, A lonely 10yo boy next door, An attempted suicide, teen dating, etc. I felt like the author had me completely in the world he created."
Books_5,3,OR,"Have read all eight books and feel these people are a part of my family. I think the author wasted way too much time and detail on fillers in this book though while hurrying over the parts that the reader wanted. I won't spoil it for others by detailing my thoughts. Still glad I read it and will read number 9, if and when it's released."
Books_5,5,OR,"This is truly a lovely book that approaches the idea of death as a natural part of the cycle of life. My mother read it with me when I experienced the loss of several family members as a child. Coming from a family with very diverse religious beliefs, this was a great way of bringing about a discussion of death without imposing someone else's religious beliefs."
Books_5,5,OR,I really wasn't sure if I wanted to get this book or not.  I finally decied not to get it after reading some of the reviews.  But later on I read about it in the Star Wars magazine and saw what it was about and some of the art in it.  I knew that I had to get it after reading that article.

Books_5,5,OR,"All the Single Ladies is another outstanding novel from Dorothea Benton Frank!  I've read all her books and enjoyed every one of them immensely.  Her writing portrays down-to-earth, realistic yet delightful characters, their experiences, and emotions in ways to which readers can relate. Settling into a comfortable chair or sofa to begin reading a Frank book is the nearest thing to heaven I can imagine!"
Books_5,5,OR,"I love the authors descriptions of characters.  She treats people foibles kindly and I can always imagine knowing these people and maybe even being related to them.  All,of their little quirks she makes understandable.  She studies how people in a family affect each other and social status both within the family and outside the family affect what drives us to be who we are."
Books_5,5,OR,"This story is aging nicely. I read it again recently, many many years after reading it as a teen, and its charm is undiminished. Gentle, noble, gory and yucky in spots, displaying a deep love for the area and its people, and even including a sweet love story, this tale of a young veterinarian starting out in Yorkshire, England in the 1930's is well worth a read."
Books_5,3,OR,"I chose this book as we've recently traveled throughout the west. Though I found the storyline interesting, the story itself seemed slow moving. I was not drawn to return to the story and so the reading dragged out. I just don't feel I ever connected with the writer's voice. I am pleased to know that many of the characters were based on actual people of the era."
Books_5,3,OR,"This book might be useful for someone just digging into the issues of residential heating and cooling.  It's presentation format doesn't presume the reader has much prior knowledge of the material, which dovetails nicely with the medium-level details of the material.  I consider it a pretty decent overview, but by the time I had read it, other materials I had covered made this book redundant."
Books_5,3,OR,"After the other 2 books in the series, I was expecting to be blown away. Unfortunately, I just found these characters to be be really whiney. Especially the hero. Even the love scenes weren't as good as the scenes in the other 2 books. This just wasn't a good way to wrap up the series. I was disappointed. I gave 3 stars because I like the author."
Books_5,2,OR,"A wierd story with two completely independent plot lines that are only related because the protagonists know each other. Don't look for it to come together, or for either plot to come to much resolution. They both just kind of peter out. It was like Kava had two ideas that didn't make a book, so she just lumped them together by alternating chapters. A waste of time."
Books_5,5,OR,"I read this book at least ten years ago and I loved it then and still enjoyed reading it again this week. Years ago, I remember thinking to myself, why have they not turned this three part series into the next movie trilogy. You already have an awesome storyline in a still mega-popular franchise. What is Hollywood waiting for?  I'd pay to see it, for sure."
Books_5,4,OR,"John Grishan is among my favorite authors and I have over 20 of his books in my library. I loved ""A Time to Kill"" and was looking forward to more of the same.

The book starts slowly but the twists and turns are fascinating. I didn't like the abrupt ending though."
Books_5,5,OR,"I think this book has special implications for anyone who works with children. Recognising and understanding the differences between introversion and extroversion has particular application in our classrooms. Some children may be under stimulated, while others are desperate to switch off. Similarly, parenting and teaching children who seek high levels of risk is a challenge. This book is sure to start lots of conversations in the staff room."

Books_5,4,OR,"Family dynamics are the theme of The Burgess Boys. Expectations, or the lack of them, have controlled the lives of the brothers, sister and her son. The book leaves this reader questioning the phrase, ""I did the best I could!""

Be prepared to grow deeply involved in these people's lives!"

Books_5,5,OR,"Mystery, intrigue, and  real life drama woven around a children's book of magic and murder engaged me every step of the way as  I experienced segregation through eyes of a young, black woman lawyer and a small town. I smelled and felt the magic of place through the intricately woven drama of characters who came to life. Thankyou Deborah Johnson for this book I will never forget."
Books_5,4,OR,"THE GRAY MAN by Mark Greany is a rollicking good time. The first book in a successful series. Court Gentry is a former America agent who now works as an independent assassin. This guy is one bad dude and this first book sets it up. Improbable, yell, ye, but oh so much fun if you can get past that. Action. Actio. Action."
Books_5,1,OR,I know this is a popular book but it was not right for me. I tried reading this for my book club. I started from the beginning 3 times and could not get into it. Then I skipped ahead about 50 pages to see if it would catch my interest.  It never did.  I am glad I saw the movie but this book was not for me.
Books_5,4,OR,"This is my first John Grisham book I ever read.  (I know, a little late to the party).  This was awesome.  I'm not a lawyer but have always been interested in life in the legal system. I had no idea how readable and colorful a book like this could be.  I've already bought another one and don't have any plans on stopping any time soon!"

I love to try new things, and love learning about sewing which is something I have loved since I learned in High school many years ago. Still sewing and machine embroidering and always learning new things, in my 60 something years."
Books_5,4,OR,"I read this book as part of a class on writing essays. The advice in it is apt, but it was too basic for the good writers in the group. The nonwriters, on the other hand, found it all amazing and startling stuff. I'd recommend it for those who have read enough to know what a complete sentence looks like but have never seriously written before and want to."
Books_5,4,OR,"OK, I am a HUGE James Patterson fan and I love the more recent novels.  While I agree that this is no Alex Delaware story, I still enjoyed it quite a bit.  I usually like a good scary movie and this has all the makings of one.  The plots twists and the church involvement make me terrified at times.  Definitely worth an open minded read!"
Books_5,4,OR,"My 2 1/2-year-old son loves this sweet, gentle story -- as do I.  It's great in that the characters aren't all cookie-cutter children's characters.  The little girl lives in an apartment in the city, the mother initially rejects the teddy bear because he's missing a button in the store, etc.  If it's possible for a book to be both realistic AND whimsical, this one did it."
Books_5,4,OR,"What is significant about this book is not the literary style, but the the research that exposed the many,many wrong decisions that got our country into this horrible war.  These many wrong decisions were made by many supposedly brilliant individuals most of whom thought they were a member of some elite group and thought they were somehow qualified to make decisions that they were totally unqualified to make."

Books_5,5,CG,"I read this book 15 years ago and thought it was a great book, but I was just starting to get tired of the details, and the writing style was not so great as it was with the other books.

Books_5,5,CG,This book toys with your imagination. The characters are well developed and believable. The writing is just as good as the story. I liked the story and the illustrations are so great. I enjoyed this book. It was a little slow going. I liked the setting. The book had a lot of twists and turns.
Books_5,4,CG,An great book for understanding what happens when you try to take a stand for a cause. It is so informative that I am not sure why I have not read more of it. I have had this book in my collection for several years. I really enjoyed this book. I love a good mystery with a good twist.

Books_5,5,OR,"This is by far my favorite version of Beauty and the Beast. I like that the family love one another instead of the usual not so loving family that frequently is written of.
I also adore that Beauty has her horse with her and that her passions are books and horses.
This is an incredibly well written book and I highly recommend this as an addition to your library of fantasy tales!"
Books_5,3,OR,"I've never read a Dean Koontz I didn't finish, and that's saying a lot for the author.  I haven't read any further into the series, though I probably will.  I wouldn't call it page-turning.  If you haven't read Koontz before don't start with this.  If you have and you're like me - you just want something you know you'll read - this might be for you."
Books_5,5,OR,"To say I enjoyed this book is a humongous understatement! The story, characters,setting and prose held me captive page after thrilling page. Not once did the author lose his mastery, and I watched events unfold as if I was there but also reading a history book about real people, battles, and places. Sword and sorcery fanatics, feed you addiction with this read. I would have added more stars if possible."
Books_5,5,OR,"The rare book that lives up to its rave reviews. I am always looking for books that tell the story of ordinary people living their lives. People that one can believe in. People with their flaws, but also capable of passion and compassion. The reader believes in these people and wishes them well. Ordinary lives become extraordinary.

The book is paired with Home, which is as good in a different way."
Books_5,5,OR,"Janet Evanovich has delivered another great Stephanie Plum book in even more humorous and wacky situations. Hard to put down, this laugh-out-loud-until-tears-run-down-your-face book has a character that somehow manages to survive dead bodies, bad hair, dead bodies, her grandmother, bombs, a healthy libido, and more dead bodies as she searches for local favorite turned fugitive Uncle Mo. Even better than the first two in this series. Very fun to read."
Books_5,5,OR,"This I read for the book club I'm in and it sounded great, but then when I first got it I was a little overwhelmed at the size, I think because it was a hardback and so large. But I found I enjoyed it all the way through, the characters are real and have flaws, very humans ones at that considering they are not. Great turn of the century novel."
Books_5,5,OR,Mrs Mike is an old friend. I first read and enjoyed this book more than 35 years ago.  This story chronicals the life of mountie Sgt Mike and Mrs. Mike.

Books_5,5,OR,"This was a very entertaining read.  I enjoyed hearing the adventures that the two main characters had in their lives.  It was a surprise to read of the extreme illness that Robert Louis Stevenson endured.  And, without his wife he probably wouldn't have lived as long as he did.  The story from her perspective took a dark turn near the end which was a surprise too."
